Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Climate Change Trend
Text: Atmosphere  Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth’s surface than any preceding decade since 1850. The period from 1983 to 2012 was very likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 800 years in the Northern Hemisphere, where such assessment is possible and likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 1400 years.  The globally averaged combined land and ocean surface temperature data as calculated by a linear trend show a warming of 0.85 [0.65 to 1.06] °C20 over the period 1880 to 2012, for which multiple independently produced datasets exist. The total increase between the average of the 1850–1900 period and the 2003–2012 period is 0.78 [0.72 to 0.85] °C, based on the single longest dataset available. For the longest period when calculation of regional trends is sufficiently complete, almost the entire globe has experienced surface warming.  In addition to robust multi-decadal warming, the globally averaged surface temperature exhibits substantial decadal and interannual variability. Due to this natural variability, trends based on short records are very sensitive to the beginning and end dates and do not in general reflect long-term climate trends. As one example, the rate of warming over the past 15 years , which begins with a strong El Niño, is smaller than the rate calculated since 1951 .  Based on multiple independent analyses of measurements, it is virtually certain that globally the troposphere has warmed and the lower stratosphere has cooled since the mid-20th century. There is medium confidence in the rate of change and its vertical structure in the Northern Hemisphere extratropical troposphere.  Confidence in precipitation change averaged over global land areas since 1901 is low prior to 1951 and medium afterwards. Averaged over the mid-latitude land areas of the Northern Hemisphere, precipitation has likely increased since 1901 . For other latitudes area-averaged long-term positive or negative trends have low confidence.<end_of_turn>

Text: Ocean  Ocean warming dominates the increase in energy stored in the climate system, accounting for more than 90% of the energy accumulated between 1971 and 2010 with only about 1% stored in the atmosphere. On a global scale, the ocean warming is largest near the surface, and the upper 75 m warmed by 0.11 [0.09 to 0.13] °C per decade over the period 1971 to 2010. It is virtually certain that the upper ocean warmed from 1971 to 2010, and it likely warmed between the 1870s and 1971. It is likely that the ocean warmed from 700 to 2000 m from 1957 to 2009 and from 3000 m to the bottom for the period 1992 to 2005.  It is very likely that regions of high surface salinity, where evaporation dominates, have become more saline, while regions of low salinity, where precipitation dominates, have become fresher since the 1950s. These regional trends in ocean salinity provide indirect evidence for changes in evaporation and precipitation over the oceans and thus for changes in the global water cycle. There is no observational evidence of a long-term trend in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.  Since the beginning of the industrial era, oceanic uptake of CO2 has resulted in acidification of the ocean; the pH of ocean surface water has decreased by 0.1, corresponding to a 26% increase in acidity, measured as hydrogen ion concentration. There is medium confidence that, in parallel to warming, oxygen concentrations have decreased in coastal waters and in the open ocean thermocline in many ocean regions since the 1960s, with a likely expansion of tropical oxygen minimum zones in recent decades.<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Ice Melting
Text: Cryosphere  Over the last two decades, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have been losing mass. Glaciers have continued to shrink almost worldwide. Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover has continued to decrease in extent. There is high confidence that there are strong regional differences in the trend in Antarctic sea ice extent, with a very likely increase in total extent.  Glaciers have lost mass and contributed to sea level rise throughout the 20th century. The rate of ice mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet has very likely substantially increased over the period 1992 to 2011, resulting in a larger mass loss over 2002 to 2011 than over 1992 to 2011. The rate of ice mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet, mainly from the northern Antarctic Peninsula and the Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica, is also likely larger over 2002 to 2011.  The annual mean Arctic sea ice extent decreased over the period 1979 to 2012. The rate of decrease was very likely in the range 3.5 to 4.1% per decade. Arctic sea ice extent has decreased in every season and in every successive decade since 1979, with the most rapid decrease in decadal mean extent in summer . For the summer sea ice minimum, the decrease was very likely in the range of 9.4 to 13.6% per decade  . It is very likely that the annual mean Antarctic sea ice extent increased in the range of 1.2 to 1.8% per decade between 1979 and 2012. However, there is high confidence that there are strong regional differences in Antarctica, with extent increasing in some regions and decreasing in others.  There is very high confidence that the extent of Northern Hemisphere snow cover has decreased since the mid-20th century by 1.6 [0.8 to 2.4] % per decade for March and April, and 11.7% per decade for June, over the 1967 to 2012 period. There is high confidence that permafrost temperatures have increased in most regions of the Northern Hemisphere since the early 1980s, with reductions in thickness and areal extent in some regions. The increase in permafrost temperatures has occurred in response to increased surface temperature and changing snow cover.<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Sea Level
Text: Sea level  Over the period 1901–2010, global mean sea level rose by 0.19 [0.17 to 0.21] m. The rate of sea level rise since the mid-19th century has been larger than the mean rate during the previous two millennia.  It is very likely that the mean rate of global averaged sea level rise was 1.7 [1.5 to 1.9] mm/yr between 1901 and 2010 and 3.2 [2.8 to 3.6] mm/yr between 1993 and 2010. Tide gauge and satellite altimeter data are consistent regarding the higher rate during the latter period. It is likely that similarly high rates occurred between 1920 and 1950.  Since the early 1970s, glacier mass loss and ocean thermal expansion from warming together explain about 75% of the observed global mean sea level rise. Over the period 1993–2010, global mean sea level rise is, with high confidence, consistent with the sum of the observed contributions from ocean thermal expansion, due to warming, from changes in glaciers, the Greenland ice sheet, the Antarctic ice sheet and land water storage.  Rates of sea level rise over broad regions can be several times larger or smaller than the global mean sea level rise for periods of several decades, due to fluctuations in ocean circulation. Since 1993, the regional rates for the Western Pacific are up to three times larger than the global mean, while those for much of the Eastern Pacific are near zero or negative.  There is very high confidence that maximum global mean sea level during the last interglacial period was, for several thousand years, at least 5 m higher than present and high confidence that it did not exceed 10 m above present. During the last interglacial period, the Greenland ice sheet very likely contributed between 1.4 and 4.3 m to the higher global mean sea level, implying with medium confidence an additional contribution from the Antarctic ice sheet. This change in sea level occurred in the context of different orbital forcing and with high-latitude surface temperature, averaged over several thousand years, at least 2°C warmer than present .<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Anthropogenic Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Text: Natural and anthropogenic radiative forcings  Atmospheric concentrations of GHGs are at levels that are unprecedented in at least 800, years. Concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide have all shown large increases since 1750  . CO2 concentrations are increasing at the fastest observed decadal rate of change for 2002– 2011. After almost one decade of stable CH4 concentrations since the late 1990s, atmospheric measurements have shown renewed increases since 2007. N2O concentrations have steadily increased at a rate of 0.73 ± 0.03 ppb/yr over the last three decades.  The total anthropogenic radiative forcing over 1750–2011 is calculated to be a warming effect of 2.3 [1.1 to 3.3] W/m , and it has increased more rapidly since 1970 than during prior decades. Carbon dioxide is the largest single contributor to radiative forcing over 1750–2011 and its trend since 1970. The total anthropogenic radiative forcing estimate for 2011 is substantially higher than the estimate reported in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report for the year 2005. This is caused by a combination of continued growth in most GHG concentrations and an improved estimate of radiative forcing from aerosols.  The radiative forcing from aerosols, which includes cloud adjustments, is better understood and indicates a weaker cooling effect than in AR4. The aerosol radiative forcing over 1750–2011 is estimated as –0.9 [–1.9 to −0.1] W/m . Radiative forcing from aerosols has two competing components: a dominant cooling effect from most aerosols and their cloud adjustments and a partially offsetting warming contribution from black carbon absorption of solar radiation. There is high confidence that the global mean total aerosol radiative forcing has counteracted a substantial portion of radiative forcing from wellmixed GHGs. Aerosols continue to contribute the largest uncertainty to the total radiative forcing estimate.  Changes in solar irradiance and volcanic aerosols cause natural radiative forcing. The radiative forcing from stratospheric volcanic aerosols can have a large cooling effect on the climate system for some years after major volcanic eruptions. Changes in total solar irradiance are calculated to have contributed only around 2% of the total radiative forcing in 2011, relative to 1750. Human activities affecting emission drivers  About half of the cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions between 1750 and 2011 have occurred in the last 40 years . Cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions of 2040 ± 310 GtCO2 were added to the atmosphere between 1750 and 2011. Since 1970, cumulative CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion, cement production and flaring have tripled, and cumulative CO2 emissions from forestry and other land use22 have increased by about 40% 23. In 2011, annual CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion, cement production and flaring were 34.8 ± 2.9 GtCO2/yr. For 2002–2011, average annual emissions from FOLU were 3.3 ± 2.9 GtCO2/yr.  About 40% of these anthropogenic CO2 emissions have remained in the atmosphere since 1750. The rest was removed from the atmosphere by sinks, and stored in natural carbon cycle reservoirs. Sinks from ocean uptake and vegetation with soils account, in roughly equal measures, for the remainder of the cumulative CO2 emissions. The ocean has absorbed about 30% of the emitted anthropogenic CO2, causing ocean acidification.  Total annual anthropogenic GHG emissions have continued to increase over 1970 to 2010 with larger absolute increases between 2000 and 2010. Despite a growing number of climate change mitigation policies, annual GHG emissions grew on average by 1.0 GtCO2-eq per year, from 2000 to 2010, compared to 0.4 GtCO2-eq per year, from 1970 to 2000 24. Total anthropogenic GHG emissions from 2000 to 2010 were the highest in human history and reached 49 GtCO2-eq/yr in 2010. The global economic crisis of 2007/2008 reduced emissions only temporarily.  CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes contributed about 78% to the total GHG emission increase between 1970 and 2010, with a contribution of similar percentage over the 2000–2010 period. Fossil-fuel-related CO2 emissions reached 32 GtCO2/yr, in 2010, and grew further by about 3% between 2010 and 2011, and by about 1 to 2% between 2011 and 2012. CO2 remains the major anthropogenic GHG, accounting for 76% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2010. Of the total, 16% comes from CH4, 6.2% from N2O, and 2.0% from fluorinated gases 25. Annually, since 1970, about 25% of anthropogenic GHG emissions have been in the form of non-CO2 gases.  Total annual anthropogenic GHG emissions have increased by about 10 GtCO2-eq between 2000 and 2010. This increase directly came from the energy, industry, transport and building sectors. Accounting for indirect emissions raises the contributions by the building and industry sectors. Since 2000, GHG emissions have been growing in all sectors, except in agriculture, forestry and other land use 22. In 2010, 35% of GHG emissions were released by the energy sector, 24% from AFOLU, 21% by industry, 14% by transport and 6.4% by the building sector. When emissions from electricity and heat production are attributed to the sectors that use the final energy, the shares of the industry and building sectors in global GHG emissions are increased to 31% and 19%, respectively.  See also Box 3.2 for contributions from various sectors, based on metrics other than 100-year Global Warming Potential. Globally, economic and population growth continue to be the most important drivers of increases in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. The contribution of population growth between 2000 and 2010 remained roughly identical to that of the previous three decades, while the contribution of economic growth has risen sharply. Between 2000 and 2010, both drivers outpaced emission reductions from improvements in energy intensity of gross domestic product. Increased use of coal relative to other energy sources has reversed the long-standing trend in gradual decarbonization  of the world’s energy supply.<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Human Influence on Climate Change
Text: Attribution of climate  changes and impacts The evidence for human influence on the climate system has grown since AR4. Human influence has been detected in warming of the atmosphere and the ocean, in changes in the global water cycle, in reductions in snow and ice, and in global mean sea level rise; and it is extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid20th century. In recent decades, changes in climate have caused impacts on natural and human systems on all continents and across the oceans. Impacts are due to observed climate change, irrespective of its cause, indicating the sensitivity of natural and human systems to changing climate. The causes of observed changes in the climate system, as well as in any natural or human system impacted by climate, are established following a consistent set of methods. Detection addresses the question of whether climate or a natural or human system affected by climate has actually changed in a statistical sense, while attribution evaluates the relative contributions of multiple causal factors to an observed change or event with an assignment of statistical confidence. Attribution of climate change to causes quantifies the links between observed climate change and human activity, as well as other, natural, climate drivers. In contrast, attribution of observed impacts to climate change considers the links between observed changes in natural or human systems and observed climate change, regardless of its cause. Results from studies attributing climate change to causes provide estimates of the magnitude of warming in response to changes in radiative forcing and hence support projections of future climate change. Results from studies attributing impacts to climate change provide strong indications for the sensitivity of natural or human systems to future climate change.<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Impacts of Climate Change
Text: Observed impacts attributed to climate change  In recent decades, changes in climate have caused impacts on natural and human systems on all continents and across the oceans. Impacts are due to observed climate change, irrespective of its cause, indicating the sensitivity of natural and human systems to changing climate. Evidence of observed climate change impacts is strongest and most comprehensive for natural systems. Some impacts on human systems have also been attributed to climate change, with a major or minor contribution of climate change distinguishable from other influences. Impacts on human systems are often geographically heterogeneous because they depend not only on changes in climate variables but also on social and economic factors. Hence, the changes are more easily observed at local levels, while attribution can remain difficult.  In many regions, changing precipitation or melting snow and ice are altering hydrological systems, affecting water resources in terms of quantity and quality. Glaciers continue to shrink almost worldwide due to climate change , affecting runoff and water resources downstream . Climate change is causing permafrost warming and thawing in high-latitude regions and in high-elevation regions .  Many terrestrial, freshwater and marine species have shifted their geographic ranges, seasonal activities, migration patterns, abundances and species interactions in response to ongoing climate change. While only a few recent species extinctions have been attributed as yet to climate change , natural global climate change at rates slower than current anthropogenic climate change caused significant ecosystem shifts and species extinctions during the past millions of years. Increased tree mortality, observed in many places worldwide, has been attributed to climate change in some regions. Increases in the frequency or intensity of ecosystem disturbances such as droughts, windstorms, fires and pest outbreaks have been detected in many parts of the world and in some cases are attributed to climate change . Numerous observations over the last decades in all ocean basins show changes in abundance, distribution shifts poleward and/ or to deeper, cooler waters for marine fishes, invertebrates and phytoplankton, and altered ecosystem composition , tracking climate trends. Some warm-water corals and their reefs have responded to warming with species replacement, bleaching, and decreased coral cover causing habitat loss . Some impacts of ocean acidification on marine organisms have been attributed to human influence, from the thinning of pteropod and foraminiferan shells to the declining growth rates of corals. Oxygen minimum zones are progressively expanding in the tropical Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans, due to reduced ventilation and O2 solubility in warmer, more stratified oceans, and are constraining fish habitat.  Assessment of many studies covering a wide range of regions and crops shows that negative impacts of climate change on crop yields have been more common than positive impacts . The smaller number of studies showing positive impacts relate mainly to high-latitude regions, though it is not yet clear whether the balance of impacts has been negative or positive in these regions. Climate change has negatively affected wheat and maize yields for many regions and in the global aggregate. Effects on rice and soybean yield have been smaller in major production regions and globally, with a median change of zero across all available data which are fewer for soy compared to the other crops. Observed impacts relate mainly to production aspects of food security rather than access or other components of food security. Since AR4, several periods of rapid food and cereal price increases following climate extremes in key producing regions indicate a sensitivity of current markets to climate extremes among other factors .  At present the worldwide burden of human ill-health from climate change is relatively small compared with effects of other stressors and is not well quantified. However, there has been increased heat-related mortality and decreased cold-related mortality in some regions as a result of warming. Local changes in temperature and rainfall have altered the distribution of some water-borne illnesses and disease vectors.  ‘Cascading’ impacts of climate change can now be attributed along chains of evidence from physical climate through to intermediate systems and then to people. The changes in climate feeding into the cascade, in some cases, are linked to human drivers , while, in other cases, assessments of the causes of observed climate change leading into the cascade are not available. In all cases, confidence in detection and attribution to observed climate change decreases for effects further down each impact chain.<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Extreme Events
Text: Extreme events  Changes in many extreme weather and climate events have been observed since about 1950. Some of these changes have been linked to human influences, including a decrease in cold temperature extremes, an increase in warm temperature extremes, an increase in extreme high sea levels and an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events in a number of regions. It is very likely that the number of cold days and nights has decreased and the number of warm days and nights has increased on the global scale. It is likely that the frequency of heat waves has increased in large parts of Europe, Asia and Australia. It is very likely that human influence has contributed to the observed global scale changes in the frequency and intensity of daily temperature extremes since the mid-20th century. It is likely that human influence has more than doubled the probability of occurrence of heat waves in some locations.  There is medium confidence that the observed warming has increased heat-related human mortality and decreased coldrelated human mortality in some regions. Extreme heat events currently result in increases in mortality and morbidity in North America , and in Europe with impacts that vary according to people’s age, location and socio-economic factors.  There are likely more land regions where the number of heavy precipitation events has increased than where it has decreased. The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events has likely increased in North America and Europe. In other continents, confidence in trends is at most medium. It is very likely that global near-surface and tropospheric air specific humidity has increased since the 1970s. In land regions where observational coverage is sufficient for assessment, there is medium confidence that anthropogenic forcing has contributed to a global-scale intensification of heavy precipitation over the second half of the 20th century.  There is low confidence that anthropogenic climate change has affected the frequency and magnitude of fluvial floods on a global scale. The strength of the evidence is limited mainly by a lack of long-term records from unmanaged catchments. Moreover, floods are strongly influenced by many human activities impacting catchments, making the attribution of detected changes to climate change difficult. However, recent detection of increasing trends in extreme precipitation and discharges in some catchments implies greater risks of flooding on a regional scale. Costs related to flood damage, worldwide, have been increasing since the 1970s, although this is partly due to the increasing exposure of people and assets.  There is low confidence in observed global-scale trends in droughts, due to lack of direct observations, dependencies of inferred trends on the choice of the definition for drought, and due to geographical inconsistencies in drought trends. There is also low confidence in the attribution of changes in drought over global land areas since the mid-20th century, due to the same observational uncertainties and difficulties in distinguishing decadal scale variability in drought from long-term trends.  There is low confidence that long-term changes in tropical cyclone activity are robust, and there is low confidence in the attribution of global changes to any particular cause. However, it is virtually certain that intense tropical cyclone activity has increased in the North Atlantic since 1970.  It is likely that extreme sea levels  have increased since 1970, being mainly the result of mean sea level rise. Due to a shortage of studies and the difficulty of distinguishing any such impacts from other modifications to coastal systems, limited evidence is available on the impacts of sea level rise.  Impacts from recent climate-related extremes, such as heat waves, droughts, floods, cyclones and wildfires, reveal significant vulnerability and exposure of some ecosystems and many human systems to current climate variability . Impacts of such climate-related extremes include alteration of ecosystems, disruption of food production and water supply, damage to infrastructure and settlements, human morbidity and mortality and consequences for mental health and human well-being. For countries at all levels of development, these impacts are consistent with a significant lack of preparedness for current climate variability in some sectors.  Direct and insured losses from weather-related disasters have increased substantially in recent decades, both globally and regionally. Increasing exposure of people and economic assets has been the major cause of long-term increases in economic losses from weather- and climate-related disasters.<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: CO2 Correlation with Global Warming
Text: Climate system responses  Climate system properties that determine the response to external forcing have been estimated both from climate models and from analysis of past and recent climate change. The equilibrium climate sensitivity 3325is likely in the range 1.5°C to 4.5°C, extremely unlikely less than 1°C, and very unlikely greater than 6°C.  Cumulative emissions of CO2 largely determine global mean surface warming by the late 21st century and beyond. Multiple lines of evidence indicate a strong and consistent near-linear relationship across all scenarios considered between net cumulative CO2 emissions  and projected global temperature change to the year 2100. Past emissions and observed warming support this relationship within uncertainties. Any given level of warming is associated with a range of cumulative CO2 emissions , and therefore, for example, higher emissions in earlier decades imply lower emissions later.  The global mean peak surface temperature change per trillion tonnes of carbon emitted as CO2 is likely in the range of 0.8°C to 2.5°C. This quantity, called the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions, is supported by both modelling and observational evidence and applies to cumulative emissions up to about 2000 GtC.  Warming caused by CO2 emissions is effectively irreversible over multi-century timescales unless measures are taken to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Ensuring CO2-induced warming remains likely less than 2°C requires cumulative CO2 emissions from all anthropogenic sources to remain below about 3650 GtCO2, over half of which were already emitted by 2011.  Multi-model results show that limiting total human-induced warming to less than 2°C relative to the period 1861–1880 with a probability of >66% would require total CO2 emissions from all anthropogenic sources since 1870 to be limited to about 2900 GtCO2 when accounting for non-CO2 forcing as in the RCP2.6 scenario, with a range of 2550 to 3150 GtCO2 arising from variations in non-CO2 climate drivers across the scenarios considered by WGIII. About 1900 [1650 to 2150] GtCO2 were emitted by 2011, leaving about 1000 GtCO2 to be consistent with this temperature goal. Estimated total fossil carbon reserves exceed this remaining amount by a factor of 4 to 7, with resources much larger still.<end_of_turn>

Extreme precipitation events over most mid-latitude land masses and over wet tropical regions will very likely become more intense and more frequent as global mean surface temperature increases.

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Ocean Warming
Text: Ocean, cryosphere and sea level  The global ocean will continue to warm during the 21st century. The strongest ocean warming is projected for the surface in tropical and Northern Hemisphere subtropical regions. At greater depth the warming will be most pronounced in the Southern Ocean .  It is very likely that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation will weaken over the 21st century, with best estimates and model ranges for the reduction of 11% for the RCP2.6 scenario, 34% for the RCP8.5. Nevertheless, it is very unlikely that the AMOC will undergo an abrupt transition or collapse in the 21st century.  Year-round reductions in Arctic sea ice are projected for all RCP scenarios. The subset of models that most closely reproduce the observationsproject that a nearly ice-free Arctic Oceanin September is likely for RCP8.5 before mid-century. In the Antarctic, a decrease in sea ice extent and volume is projected with low confidence.  The area of Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover is likely to decrease by 7% for RCP2.6 and by 25% in RCP8.5 by the end of the 21st century for the multi-model average.  It is virtually certain that near-surface permafrost extent at high northern latitudes will be reduced as global mean surface temperature increases. The area of permafrost near the surface  is likely to decrease by 37% to 81% for the multi-model average.  The global glacier volume, excluding glaciers on the periphery of Antarctica, is projected to decrease by 15 to 55% for RCP2.6 and by 35 to 85% for RCP8.5.  Global mean sea level will continue to rise during the 21st century. There has been significant improvement in understanding and projection of sea level change since the AR4. Under all RCP scenarios, the rate of sea level rise will very likely exceed the observed rate of 2.0 [1.7–2.3] mm/yr during 1971–2010, with the rate of rise for RCP8.5 during 2081–2100 of 8 to 16 mm/yr .  Sea level rise will not be uniform across regions. By the end of the 21st century, it is very likely that sea level will rise in more than about 95% of the ocean area. Sea level rise depends on the pathway of CO2 emissions, not only on the cumulative total; reducing emissions earlier rather than later, for the same cumulative total, leads to a larger mitigation of sea level rise. About 70% of the coastlines worldwide are projected to experience sea level change within ±20% of the global mean. It is very likely that there will be a significant increase in the occurrence of future sea level extremes in some regions by 2100.<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Acidification
Text: Carbon cycle and biogeochemistry  Ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 will continue under all four RCPs through to 2100, with higher uptake for higher concentration pathways. The future evolution of the land carbon uptake is less certain. A majority of models projects a continued land carbon uptake under all RCPs, but some models simulate a land carbon loss due to the combined effect of climate change and land use change.  Based on Earth System Models, there is high confidence that the feedback between climate change and the carbon cycle will amplify global warming. Climate change will partially offset increases in land and ocean carbon sinks caused by rising atmospheric CO2. As a result more of the emitted anthropogenic CO2 will remain in the atmosphere, reinforcing the warming.  Earth System Models project a global increase in ocean acidification for all RCP scenarios by the end of the 21st century, with a slow recovery after mid-century under RCP2.6. The decrease in surface ocean pH is in the range of 0.06 to 0.07  for RCP2.6, 0.14 to 0.15 for RCP4.5, 0.20 to 0.21 for RCP6.0, and 0.30 to 0.32 for RCP8.5 .  It is very likely that the dissolved oxygen content of the ocean will decrease by a few percent during the 21st century in response to surface warming, predominantly in the subsurface mid-latitude oceans. There is no consensus on the future volume of low oxygen waters in the open ocean because of large uncertainties in potential biogeochemical effects and in the evolution of tropical ocean dynamics.<end_of_turn>

Sea level rise will not be uniform across regions. By the end of the 21st century, it is very likely that sea level will rise in more than about 95% of the ocean area. Sea level rise depends on the pathway of CO2 emissions, not only on the cumulative total; reducing emissions earlier rather than later, for the same cumulative total, leads to a larger mitigation of sea level rise. About 70% of the coastlines worldwide are projected to experience sea level change within ±20% of the global mean. It is very likely that there will be a significant increase in the occurrence of future sea level extremes in some regions by 2100.<end_of_turn>

Text: Ocean, cryosphere and sea level  The global ocean will continue to warm during the 21st century. The strongest ocean warming is projected for the surface in tropical and Northern Hemisphere subtropical regions. At greater depth the warming will be most pronounced in the Southern Ocean .  It is very likely that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation will weaken over the 21st century, with best estimates and model ranges for the reduction of 11% for the RCP2.6 scenario, 34% for the RCP8.5. Nevertheless, it is very unlikely that the AMOC will undergo an abrupt transition or collapse in the 21st century.  Year-round reductions in Arctic sea ice are projected for all RCP scenarios. The subset of models that most closely reproduce the observationsproject that a nearly ice-free Arctic Oceanin September is likely for RCP8.5 before mid-century. In the Antarctic, a decrease in sea ice extent and volume is projected with low confidence.  The area of Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover is likely to decrease by 7% for RCP2.6 and by 25% in RCP8.5 by the end of the 21st century for the multi-model average.  It is virtually certain that near-surface permafrost extent at high northern latitudes will be reduced as global mean surface temperature increases. The area of permafrost near the surface  is likely to decrease by 37% to 81% for the multi-model average.  The global glacier volume, excluding glaciers on the periphery of Antarctica, is projected to decrease by 15 to 55% for RCP2.6 and by 35 to 85% for RCP8.5.  Global mean sea level will continue to rise during the 21st century. There has been significant improvement in understanding and projection of sea level change since the AR4. Under all RCP scenarios, the rate of sea level rise will very likely exceed the observed rate of 2.0 [1.7–2.3] mm/yr during 1971–2010, with the rate of rise for RCP8.5 during 2081–2100 of 8 to 16 mm/yr .

Text: Sure, here's a summary of the main takeaways from the text with respect to the topic:  - Exposure and vulnerability are influenced by a range of social, economic and cultural factors and processes that have been incompletely considered to date.   - Differences in vulnerability and exposure arise from non-climatic factors and from multidimensional inequalities often produced by uneven development processes.   - Climate-related hazards exacerbate other stressors, often with negative outcomes for livelihoods, especially for people living in poverty.   - Observed positive effects for poor and marginalized people, which are limited and often indirect, include diversification of social networks and of agricultural practices.   - Violent conflict increases vulnerability to climate change.<eos> Sure, here's a summary of the main takeaways from the text with respect to the topic:  **Key Risks of Climate Change:**  * **Increased severity and frequency of extreme weather events:**

and disrupted livelihoods:** These risks are particularly significant for vulnerable populations and communities. * **Systemic risks:** Extreme weather events can damage infrastructure and disrupt critical services, leading to broader economic and social impacts. * **Food and water insecurity:** These risks are particularly acute for vulnerable populations and can have significant social and economic consequences. * **Loss of ecosystems and biodiversity:** These risks can have significant impacts on the environment and human well-being.  **Importance of Adaptation:**  * Adaptation can help reduce the risks of climate change impacts, but it is not a substitute for mitigation efforts. * The potential for adaptation varies among sectors, regions, communities, and ecosystems. * The scope for adaptation changes over time and is closely linked to socio-economic development pathways and circumstances.<eos> Sure, here's a summary of the main takeaways from the text with respect to the topic:  * Climate change will continue for centuries even after anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are stopped.   * Abrupt or irreversible changes increase as the magnitude of the warming increases.   * Global mean sea level rise will continue for many centuries beyond 2100.   * Ocean acidification will continue for centuries if CO2 emissions continue.   * There is low confidence in assessing the evolution of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation beyond the 21st century.   * Sustained global warming greater than a threshold would lead to the near-complete loss of the Greenland ice sheet over a millennium or more, causing a sea level rise of up to 7 m.   * Magnitude and rates of climate change associated with medium to high emission scenarios pose a high risk of abrupt and irreversible regional-scale change in the composition, structure and function of marine, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems.<eos> Sure, here's a summary of the main takeaways from the text with respect to the topic:  * **Adaptation is effective but has limits:** While adaptation can reduce the risks of climate change impacts, it has limits in terms of its effectiveness when dealing with greater magnitudes and rates of climate change.   * **Long-term perspective is crucial:** Taking a long-term perspective increases the likelihood that more immediate adaptation actions will also enhance future options and preparedness.   * **Vulnerability and exposure are key factors:** Adaptation planning and implementation should consider vulnerability and exposure to ensure that the target group is not disproportionately affected by the adaptation measures.   * **Integration across levels is essential:** Adaptation planning and implementation should be coordinated across different levels of government, from local to national, to ensure that all relevant stakeholders are involved.   * **Transformational adaptation is important:** Transformational adaptation can enhance adaptation by introducing new technologies, practices, and institutions.   * **Building adaptive capacity is crucial:** Successful adaptation requires not only identifying adaptation options but also increasing the adaptive capacity of human and natural systems.   * **Co-benefits and trade-offs exist between mitigation and adaptation:** Actions that reduce emissions of climate-altering pollutants can also provide co-benefits, such as improved air quality and reduced water consumption.<eos><end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Animal Extiction
Text: Future risks and impacts caused  by a changing climate Climate change will amplify existing risks and create new risks for natural and human systems. Risks are unevenly distributed and are generally greater for disadvantaged people and communities in countries at all levels of development. Increasing magnitudes of warming increase the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people, species and ecosystems. Continued high emissions would lead to mostly negative impacts for biodiversity, ecosystem services and economic development and amplify risks for livelihoods and for food and human security. Risk of climate-related impacts results from the interaction of climate-related hazards with the vulnerability and exposure of human and natural systems, including their ability to adapt. Rising rates and magnitudes of warming and other changes in the climate system, accompanied by ocean acidification, increase the risk of severe, pervasive, and in some cases, irreversible detrimental impacts. Future climate change will amplify existing climate-related risks and create new risks.  Key risks are potentially severe impacts relevant to understanding dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Risks are considered key due to high hazard or high vulnerability of societies and systems exposed, or both. Their identification is based on large magnitude or high probability of impacts; irreversibility or timing of impacts; persistent vulnerability or exposure; or limited potential to reduce risks. Some risks are particularly relevant for individual regions, while others are global. For risk assessment it is important to evaluate the widest possible range of impacts, including low-probability outcomes with large consequences. Risk levels often increase with temperature and are sometimes more directly linked to other dimensions of climate change, such as the rate of warming, as well as the magnitudes and rates of ocean acidification and sea level rise .  Key risks that span sectors and regions include the following : 1. Risk of severe ill-health and disrupted livelihoods resulting from storm surges, sea level rise and coastal flooding; inland flooding in some urban regions; and periods of extreme heat. 2. Systemic risks due to extreme weather events leading to breakdown of infrastructure networks and critical services. 3. Risk of food and water insecurity and loss of rural livelihoods and income, particularly for poorer populations. 4. Risk of loss of ecosystems, biodiversity and ecosystem goods, functions and services. The overall risks of future climate change impacts can be reduced by limiting the rate and magnitude of climate change, including ocean acidification. Some risks are considerable even at 1°C global mean temperature increase above pre-industrial levels. Many global risks are high to very high for global temperature increases of 4°C or more. These risks include severe and widespread impacts on unique and threatened systems, the extinction of many species, large risks to food security and compromised normal human activities, including growing food or working outdoors in some areas for parts of the year, due to the combination of high temperature and humidity. The precise levels of climate change sufficient to trigger abrupt and irreversible change remain uncertain, but the risk associated with crossing such thresholds in the earth system or in interlinked human and natural systems increases with rising temperature.  Adaptation can substantially reduce the risks of climate change impacts, but greater rates and magnitude of climate change increase the likelihood of exceeding adaptation limits . The potential for adaptation, as well as constraints and limits to adaptation, varies among sectors, regions, communities and ecosystems. The scope for adaptation changes over time and is closely linked to socio-economic development pathways and circumstances. See Figure 2.4 and Table 2.3, along with Topics 3 and 4. Climate change beyond 2100,  irreversibility and abrupt changes Many aspects of climate change and its associated impacts will continue for centuries, even if anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are stopped. The risks of abrupt or irreversible changes increase as the magnitude of the warming increases. Warming will continue beyond 2100 under all RCP scenarios except RCP2.6. Surface temperatures will remain approximately constant at elevated levels for many centuries after a complete cessation of net anthropogenic CO2 emissions . A large fraction of anthropogenic climate change resulting from CO2 emissions is irreversible on a multi-century to millennial timescale, except in the case of a large net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere over a sustained period.  Stabilization of global average surface temperature does not imply stabilization for all aspects of the climate system. Shifting biomes, re-equilibrating soil carbon, ice sheets, ocean temperatures and associated sea level rise all have their own intrinsic long timescales that will result in ongoing changes for hundreds to thousands of years after global surface temperature has been stabilized.  Ocean acidification will continue for centuries if CO2 emissions continue, it will strongly affect marine ecosystems , and the impact will be exacerbated by rising temperature extremes.  Global mean sea level rise will continue for many centuries beyond 2100. The few available analyses that go beyond 2100 indicate sea level rise to be less than 1 m above the pre-industrial level by 2300 for GHG concentrations that peak and decline and remain below 500 ppm CO2-eq, as in scenario RCP2.6. For a radiative forcing that corresponds to a CO2-eq concentration in 2100 that is above 700 ppm but below 1500 ppm, as in scenario RCP8.5, the projected rise is 1 m to more than 3 m by 2300 . There is low confidence in the available models’ ability to project solid ice discharge from the Antarctic ice sheet. Hence, these models likely underestimate the Antarctica ice sheet contribution, resulting in an underestimation of projected sea level rise beyond 2100.  There is little evidence in global climate models of a tipping point or critical threshold in the transition from a perennially ice-covered to a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean, beyond which further sea-ice loss is unstoppable and irreversible.  There is low confidence in assessing the evolution of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation beyond the 21st century because of the limited number of analyses and equivocal results. However, a collapse beyond the 21st century for large sustained warming cannot be excluded.  Sustained mass loss by ice sheets would cause larger sea level rise, and part of the mass loss might be irreversible. There is high confidence that sustained global mean warming greater than a threshold would lead to the near-complete loss of the Greenland ice sheet over a millennium or more, causing a sea level rise of up to 7 m. Current estimates indicate that the threshold is greater than about 1°C but less than about 4°C of global warming with respect to pre-industrial temperatures. Abrupt and irreversible ice loss from a potential instability of marine-based sectors of the Antarctic ice sheet in response to climate forcing is possible, but current evidence and understanding is insufficient to make a quantitative assessment.  Within the 21st century, magnitudes and rates of climate change associated with medium to high emission scenarios  pose a high risk of abrupt and irreversible regional-scale change in the composition, structure and function of marine, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, including wetlands, as well as warm water coral reefs . Examples that could substantially amplify climate change are the boreal-tundra Arctic system and the Amazon forest.  A reduction in permafrost extent is virtually certain with continued rise in global temperatures. Current permafrost areas are projected to become a net emitter of carbon with a loss of 180 to 920 GtCO2 under RCP8.5 over the 21st century .<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Economic Impact
Text: Water, food and urban systems, human  health, security and livelihoods The fractions of the global population that will experience water scarcity and be affected by major river floods are projected to increase with the level of warming in the 21st century .  Climate change over the 21st century is projected to reduce renewable surface water and groundwater resources in most dry subtropical regions, intensifying competition for water among sectors . In presently dry regions, the frequency of droughts will likely increase by the end of the 21st century under RCP8.5. In contrast, water resources are projected to increase at high latitudes. The interaction of increased temperature; increased sediment, nutrient and pollutant loadings from heavy rainfall; increased concentrations of pollutants during droughts; and disruption of treatment facilities during floods will reduce raw water quality and pose risks to drinking water quality.  All aspects of food security are potentially affected by climate change, including food production, access, use and price stability. For wheat, rice and maize in tropical and temperate regions, climate change without adaptation is projected to negatively impact production at local temperature increases of 2°C or more above late 20th century levels, although individual locations may benefit. Projected impacts vary across crops and regions and adaptation scenarios, with about 10% of projections for the 2030–2049 period showing yield gains of more than 10%, and about 10% of projections showing yield losses of more than 25%, compared with the late 20th century. Global temperature increases of ~4°C or more above late 20th century levels, combined with increasing food demand, would pose large risks to food security, both globally and regionally. The relationship between global and regional warming is explained in 2.2.1.  Until mid-century, projected climate change will impact human health mainly by exacerbating health problems that already exist. Throughout the 21st century, climate change is expected to lead to increases in ill-health in many regions and especially in developing countries with low income, as compared to a baseline without climate change . Health impacts include greater likelihood of injury and death due to more intense heat waves and fires, increased risks from foodborne and waterborne diseases and loss of work capacity and reduced labour productivity in vulnerable populations . Risks of undernutrition in poor regions will increase . Risks from vector-borne diseases are projected to generally increase with warming, due to the extension of the infection area and season, despite reductions in some areas that become too hot for disease vectors. Globally, the magnitude and severity of negative impacts will increasingly outweigh positive impacts . By 2100 for RCP8.5, the combination of high temperature and humidity in some areas for parts of the year is expected to compromise common human activities, including growing food and working outdoors.  In urban areas, climate change is projected to increase risks for people, assets, economies and ecosystems, including risks from heat stress, storms and extreme precipitation, inland and coastal flooding, landslides, air pollution, drought, water scarcity, sea level rise and storm surges. These risks will be amplified for those lacking essential infrastructure and services or living in exposed areas.  Rural areas are expected to experience major impacts on water availability and supply, food security, infrastructure and agricultural incomes, including shifts in the production areas of food and non-food crops around the world . These impacts will disproportionately affect the welfare of the poor in rural areas, such as female-headed households and those with limited access to land, modern agricultural inputs, infrastructure and education.  Aggregate economic losses accelerate with increasing temperature, but global economic impacts from climate change are currently difficult to estimate. With recognized limitations, the existing incomplete estimates of global annual economic losses for warming of ~2.5°C above pre-industrial levels are 0.2 to 2.0% of income . Changes in population, age structure, income, technology, relative prices, lifestyle, regulation and governance are projected to have relatively larger impacts than climate change, for most economic sectors. More severe and/or frequent weather hazards are projected to increase disaster-related losses and loss variability, posing challenges for affordable insurance, particularly in developing countries. International dimensions such as trade and relations among states are also important for understanding the risks of climate change at regional scales.  From a poverty perspective, climate change impacts are projected to slow down economic growth, make poverty reduction more difficult, further erode food security and prolong existing poverty traps and create new ones, the latter particularly in urban areas and emerging hotspots of hunger . Climate change impacts are expected to exacerbate poverty in most developing countries and create new poverty pockets in countries with increasing inequality, in both developed and developing countries .  Climate change is projected to increase displacement of people . Displacement risk increases when populations that lack the resources for planned migration experience higher exposure to extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts. Expanding opportunities for mobility can reduce vulnerability for such populations. Changes in migration patterns can be responses to both extreme weather events and longer term climate variability and change, and migration can also be an effective adaptation strategy.  Climate change can indirectly increase risks of violent conflict by amplifying well-documented drivers of these conflicts, such as poverty and economic shocks. Multiple lines of evidence relate climate variability to some forms of conflict.<end_of_turn>

","Sure, here's a summary of the main takeaways from the text with respect to the topic:

**Economic Impact:**

* Climate change will have significant economic impacts, with rising temperatures, increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, and changes in precipitation patterns leading to changes in crop yields and food security.
* The magnitude and severity of negative impacts will increasingly outweigh positive impacts by 2100 for RCP8.5.
* Climate change impacts are projected to be larger in developing countries, disproportionately affecting poor populations.
* The economic impacts of climate change are difficult to estimate, but existing estimates suggest that they could be significant.

**Human Health Impact:**

* Climate change will have a major impact on human health, with increased risks of injury and death from extreme heat waves and fires, increased risks from foodborne and waterborne diseases, and loss of work capacity and reduced productivity.
* Climate change impacts are projected to be particularly severe in developing countries, where poverty and inequality are already major factors.

**Environmental Impact:**

* Climate change will also have a significant impact on the environment, with rising temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events leading to changes in ecosystems and biodiversity.
* The economic and environmental impacts of climate change are closely linked, as climate change can lead to more extreme weather events and other environmental problems that can damage infrastructure and livelihoods.

**Social Impact:**

* Climate change can also have a negative impact on social cohesion and community resilience, as extreme weather events and climate-related disasters can displace people and disrupt livelihoods.
* Climate change can also exacerbate existing social inequalities, as it can make it more difficult for vulnerable populations to adapt to climate change impacts.<eos>","0.9344841012969799","0.8938198696200761","0.9518973215025606","0.7662075990933905","0.8866022228782517","18.003350257873535"

Health impacts include greater likelihood of injury and death due to more intense heat waves and fires, increased risks from foodborne and waterborne diseases and loss of work capacity and reduced labour productivity in vulnerable populations . Risks of undernutrition in poor regions will increase . Risks from vector-borne diseases are projected to generally increase with warming, due to the extension of the infection area and season, despite reductions in some areas that become too hot for disease vectors. Globally, the magnitude and severity of negative impacts will increasingly outweigh positive impacts . By 2100 for RCP8.5, the combination of high temperature and humidity in some areas for parts of the year is expected to compromise common human activities, including growing food and working outdoors.  In urban areas, climate change is projected to increase risks for people, assets, economies and ecosystems, including risks from heat stress, storms and extreme precipitation, inland and coastal flooding, landslides, air pollution, drought, water scarcity, sea level rise and storm surges. These risks will be amplified for those lacking essential infrastructure and services or living in exposed areas.  Rural areas are expected to experience major impacts on water availability and supply, food security, infrastructure and agricultural incomes, including shifts in the production areas of food and non-food crops around the world . These impacts will disproportionately affect the welfare of the poor in rural areas, such as female-headed households and those with limited access to land, modern agricultural inputs, infrastructure and education.  Aggregate economic losses accelerate with increasing temperature, but global economic impacts from climate change are currently difficult to estimate. With recognized limitations, the existing incomplete estimates of global annual economic losses for warming of ~2.5°C above pre-industrial levels are 0.2 to 2.0% of income . Changes in population, age structure, income, technology, relative prices, lifestyle, regulation and governance are projected to have relatively larger impacts than climate change, for most economic sectors. More severe and/or frequent weather hazards are projected to increase disaster-related losses and loss variability, posing challenges for affordable insurance, particularly in developing countries. International dimensions such as trade and relations among states are also important for understanding the risks of climate change at regional scales.  From a poverty perspective, climate change impacts are projected to slow down economic growth, make poverty reduction more difficult, further erode food security and prolong existing poverty traps and create new ones, the latter particularly in urban areas and emerging hotspots of hunger . Climate change impacts are expected to exacerbate poverty in most developing countries and create new poverty pockets in countries with increasing inequality, in both developed and developing countries .  Climate change is projected to increase displacement of people . Displacement risk increases when populations that lack the resources for planned migration experience higher exposure to extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts. Expanding opportunities for mobility can reduce vulnerability for such populations. Changes in migration patterns can be responses to both extreme weather events and longer term climate variability and change, and migration can also be an effective adaptation strategy.  Climate change can indirectly increase risks of violent conflict by amplifying well-documented drivers of these conflicts, such as poverty and economic shocks. Multiple lines of evidence relate climate variability to some forms of conflict.<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Surface Temperature
Text: Climate change beyond 2100,  irreversibility and abrupt changes Many aspects of climate change and its associated impacts will continue for centuries, even if anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are stopped. The risks of abrupt or irreversible changes increase as the magnitude of the warming increases. Warming will continue beyond 2100 under all RCP scenarios except RCP2.6. Surface temperatures will remain approximately constant at elevated levels for many centuries after a complete cessation of net anthropogenic CO2 emissions . A large fraction of anthropogenic climate change resulting from CO2 emissions is irreversible on a multi-century to millennial timescale, except in the case of a large net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere over a sustained period.  Stabilization of global average surface temperature does not imply stabilization for all aspects of the climate system. Shifting biomes, re-equilibrating soil carbon, ice sheets, ocean temperatures and associated sea level rise all have their own intrinsic long timescales that will result in ongoing changes for hundreds to thousands of years after global surface temperature has been stabilized.  Ocean acidification will continue for centuries if CO2 emissions continue, it will strongly affect marine ecosystems , and the impact will be exacerbated by rising temperature extremes.  Global mean sea level rise will continue for many centuries beyond 2100. The few available analyses that go beyond 2100 indicate sea level rise to be less than 1 m above the pre-industrial level by 2300 for GHG concentrations that peak and decline and remain below 500 ppm CO2-eq, as in scenario RCP2.6. For a radiative forcing that corresponds to a CO2-eq concentration in 2100 that is above 700 ppm but below 1500 ppm, as in scenario RCP8.5, the projected rise is 1 m to more than 3 m by 2300 . There is low confidence in the available models’ ability to project solid ice discharge from the Antarctic ice sheet. Hence, these models likely underestimate the Antarctica ice sheet contribution, resulting in an underestimation of projected sea level rise beyond 2100.  There is little evidence in global climate models of a tipping point or critical threshold in the transition from a perennially ice-covered to a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean, beyond which further sea-ice loss is unstoppable and irreversible.  There is low confidence in assessing the evolution of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation beyond the 21st century because of the limited number of analyses and equivocal results. However, a collapse beyond the 21st century for large sustained warming cannot be excluded.  Sustained mass loss by ice sheets would cause larger sea level rise, and part of the mass loss might be irreversible. There is high confidence that sustained global mean warming greater than a threshold would lead to the near-complete loss of the Greenland ice sheet over a millennium or more, causing a sea level rise of up to 7 m. Current estimates indicate that the threshold is greater than about 1°C but less than about 4°C of global warming with respect to pre-industrial temperatures. Abrupt and irreversible ice loss from a potential instability of marine-based sectors of the Antarctic ice sheet in response to climate forcing is possible, but current evidence and understanding is insufficient to make a quantitative assessment.  Within the 21st century, magnitudes and rates of climate change associated with medium to high emission scenarios  pose a high risk of abrupt and irreversible regional-scale change in the composition, structure and function of marine, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, including wetlands, as well as warm water coral reefs . Examples that could substantially amplify climate change are the boreal-tundra Arctic system and the Amazon forest.  A reduction in permafrost extent is virtually certain with continued rise in global temperatures. Current permafrost areas are projected to become a net emitter of carbon with a loss of 180 to 920 GtCO2 under RCP8.5 over the 21st century .<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Decision-making
Text: Foundations of decision-making  about climate change Effective decision-making to limit climate change and its effects can be informed by a wide range of analytical approaches for evaluating expected risks and benefits, recognizing the importance of governance, ethical dimensions, equity, value judgments, economic assessments and diverse perceptions and responses to risk and uncertainty. Sustainable development and equity provide a basis for assessing climate policies. Limiting the effects of climate change is necessary to achieve sustainable development and equity, including poverty eradication. Countries’ past and future contributions to the accumulation of GHGs in the atmosphere are different, and countries also face varying challenges and circumstances and have different capacities to address mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation and adaptation raise issues of equity, justice and fairness and are necessary to achieve sustainable development and poverty eradication. Many of those most vulnerable to climate change have contributed and contribute little to GHG emissions. Delaying mitigation shifts burdens from the present to the future, and insufficient adaptation responses to emerging impacts are already eroding the basis for sustainable development. Both adaptation and mitigation can have distributional effects locally, nationally and internationally, depending on who pays and who benefits. The process of decision-making about climate change, and the degree to which it respects the rights and views of all those affected, is also a concern of justice.  Effective mitigation will not be achieved if individual agents advance their own interests independently. Climate change has the characteristics of a collective action problem at the global scale, because most GHGs accumulate over time and mix globally, and emissions by any agent affect other agents. Cooperative responses, including international cooperation, are therefore required to effectively mitigate GHG emissions and address other climate change issues. The effectiveness of adaptation can be enhanced through complementary actions across levels, including international cooperation. The evidence suggests that outcomes seen as equitable can lead to more effective cooperation.  Decision-making about climate change involves valuation and mediation among diverse values and may be aided by the analytic methods of several normative disciplines. Ethics analyses the different values involved and the relations between them. Recent political philosophy has investigated the question of responsibility for the effects of emissions. Economics and decision analysis provide quantitative methods of valuation which can be used for estimating the social cost of carbon, in cost–benefit and costeffectiveness analyses, for optimization in integrated models and elsewhere. Economic methods can reflect ethical principles, and take account of non-marketed goods, equity, behavioural biases, ancillary benefits and costs and the differing values of money to different people. They are, however, subject to well-documented limitations.  Analytical methods of valuation cannot identify a single best balance between mitigation, adaptation and residual climate impacts. Important reasons for this are that climate change involves extremely complex natural and social processes, there is extensive disagreement about the values concerned, and climate change impacts and mitigation approaches have important distributional effects. Nevertheless, information on the consequences of emissions pathways to alternative climate goals and risk levels can be a useful input into decision-making processes. Evaluating responses to climate change involves assessment of the widest possible range of impacts, including low-probability outcomes with large consequences.  Effective decision-making and risk management in the complex environment of climate change may be iterative: strategies can often be adjusted as new information and understanding develops during implementation. However, adaptation and mitigation choices in the near term will affect the risks of climate change throughout the 21st century and beyond, and prospects for climate-resilient pathways for sustainable development depend on what is achieved through mitigation. Opportunities to take advantage of positive synergies between adaptation and mitigation may decrease with time, particularly if mitigation is delayed too long. Decision-making about climate change is influenced by how individuals and organizations perceive risks and uncertainties and take them into account. They sometimes use simplified decision rules, overestimate or underestimate risks and are biased towards the status quo. They differ in their degree of risk aversion and the relative importance placed on near-term versus long-term ramifications of specific actions. Formalized analytical methods for decision-making under uncertainty can account accurately for risk, and focus attention on both short- and long-term consequences.<end_of_turn>

Decision-making about climate change is influenced by how individuals and organizations perceive risks and uncertainties and take them into account. They sometimes use simplified decision rules, overestimate or underestimate risks and are biased towards the status quo. They differ in their degree of risk aversion and the relative importance placed on near-term versus long-term ramifications of specific actions. Formalized analytical methods for decision-making under uncertainty can account accurately for risk, and focus attention on both short- and long-term consequences. Interaction among mitigation, adaptation  and sustainable development Climate change is a threat to equitable and sustainable development. Adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development are closely related, with potential for synergies and trade-offs. Climate change poses an increasing threat to equitable and sustainable development. Some climate-related impacts on development are already being observed. Climate change is a threat multiplier. It exacerbates other threats to social and natural systems, placing additional burdens particularly on the poor and constraining possible development paths for all. Development along current global pathways can contribute to climate risk and vulnerability, further eroding the basis for sustainable development.  Aligning climate policy with sustainable development requires attention to both adaptation and mitigation. Interaction among adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development occurs both within and across regions and scales, often in the context of multiple stressors. Some options for responding to climate change could impose risks of other environmental and social costs, have adverse distributional effects and draw resources away from other development priorities, including poverty eradication.  Both adaptation and mitigation can bring substantial co-benefits . Examples of actions with co-benefits include improved air quality; enhanced energy security, reduced energy and water consumption in urban areas through greening cities and recycling water; sustainable agriculture and forestry; and protection of ecosystems for carbon storage and other ecosystem services.  Strategies and actions can be pursued now that will move towards climate-resilient pathways for sustainable development, while at the same time helping to improve livelihoods, social and economic well-being and effective environmental management. Prospects for climate-resilient pathways are related fundamentally to what the world accomplishes with climate change mitigation. Since mitigation reduces the rate as well as the magnitude of warming, it also increases the time available for adaptation to a particular level of climate change, potentially by several decades. Delaying mitigation actions may reduce options for climate-resilient pathways in the future.<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Designing Climate Policies
Text: Foundations of decision-making  about climate change Effective decision-making to limit climate change and its effects can be informed by a wide range of analytical approaches for evaluating expected risks and benefits, recognizing the importance of governance, ethical dimensions, equity, value judgments, economic assessments and diverse perceptions and responses to risk and uncertainty. Sustainable development and equity provide a basis for assessing climate policies. Limiting the effects of climate change is necessary to achieve sustainable development and equity, including poverty eradication. Countries’ past and future contributions to the accumulation of GHGs in the atmosphere are different, and countries also face varying challenges and circumstances and have different capacities to address mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation and adaptation raise issues of equity, justice and fairness and are necessary to achieve sustainable development and poverty eradication. Many of those most vulnerable to climate change have contributed and contribute little to GHG emissions. Delaying mitigation shifts burdens from the present to the future, and insufficient adaptation responses to emerging impacts are already eroding the basis for sustainable development. Both adaptation and mitigation can have distributional effects locally, nationally and internationally, depending on who pays and who benefits. The process of decision-making about climate change, and the degree to which it respects the rights and views of all those affected, is also a concern of justice.  Effective mitigation will not be achieved if individual agents advance their own interests independently. Climate change has the characteristics of a collective action problem at the global scale, because most GHGs accumulate over time and mix globally, and emissions by any agent affect other agents. Cooperative responses, including international cooperation, are therefore required to effectively mitigate GHG emissions and address other climate change issues. The effectiveness of adaptation can be enhanced through complementary actions across levels, including international cooperation. The evidence suggests that outcomes seen as equitable can lead to more effective cooperation.  Decision-making about climate change involves valuation and mediation among diverse values and may be aided by the analytic methods of several normative disciplines. Ethics analyses the different values involved and the relations between them. Recent political philosophy has investigated the question of responsibility for the effects of emissions. Economics and decision analysis provide quantitative methods of valuation which can be used for estimating the social cost of carbon, in cost–benefit and costeffectiveness analyses, for optimization in integrated models and elsewhere. Economic methods can reflect ethical principles, and take account of non-marketed goods, equity, behavioural biases, ancillary benefits and costs and the differing values of money to different people. They are, however, subject to well-documented limitations.  Analytical methods of valuation cannot identify a single best balance between mitigation, adaptation and residual climate impacts. Important reasons for this are that climate change involves extremely complex natural and social processes, there is extensive disagreement about the values concerned, and climate change impacts and mitigation approaches have important distributional effects. Nevertheless, information on the consequences of emissions pathways to alternative climate goals and risk levels can be a useful input into decision-making processes. Evaluating responses to climate change involves assessment of the widest possible range of impacts, including low-probability outcomes with large consequences.  Effective decision-making and risk management in the complex environment of climate change may be iterative: strategies can often be adjusted as new information and understanding develops during implementation. However, adaptation and mitigation choices in the near term will affect the risks of climate change throughout the 21st century and beyond, and prospects for climate-resilient pathways for sustainable development depend on what is achieved through mitigation.

Text: Sure, here's a summary of the main takeaways from the text with respect to the topic:  **Risks of inaction:**  * Climate change will amplify existing risks and create new risks for natural and human systems. * Risks are unevenly distributed and are generally greater for disadvantaged people and communities. * Increasing magnitudes of warming increase the likelihood of severe, pervasive, and irreversible impacts. * Continued high emissions would lead to mostly negative impacts for biodiversity, ecosystem services and economic development. * Risks of climate-related impacts result from the interaction of climate-related hazards with the vulnerability and exposure of human and natural systems.  **Key risks:**  * Severe ill-health and disrupted livelihoods resulting from storm surges, sea level rise and coastal flooding. * Systemic risks due to extreme weather events leading to breakdown of infrastructure networks and critical services. * Risk of food and water insecurity and loss of rural livelihoods and income. * Risk of loss of ecosystems, biodiversity and ecosystem goods, functions and services.  **Overall, the risks of future climate change impacts can be reduced by limiting the rate and magnitude of climate change, including ocean acidification.**<eos> Sure, here's a summary of the main takeaways from the text with respect to the topic:  * Climate change risks are much higher than those associated with adaptation. * Mitigation efforts have both co-benefits and risks, but these risks do not involve the same possibility of severe, widespread and irreversible impacts as risks from climate change. * Mitigation and adaptation are complementary approaches for reducing climate change impacts. * The level of mitigation will influence the rate and magnitude of climate change. * Without additional mitigation efforts beyond those in place today, and even with adaptation, warming by the end of the 21st century will lead to high to very high risk of severe, widespread and irreversible impacts globally. * Mitigation and adaptation can help to reduce these risks by limiting warming, reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, and adapting to the impacts of climate change.<eos> Sure, here are the main takeaways from the text:  * Mitigation pathways that reduce GHG emissions and achieve below 2°C warming relative to pre-industrial levels require substantial reductions in emissions over the next few decades and near-zero emissions of CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases by the end of the century.   * Implementing mitigation measures poses technological, economic, social, and institutional challenges.   * Limiting warming to lower or higher levels involves similar challenges but on different timescales.   * Without additional efforts to reduce GHG emissions beyond those in place today, global emission growth is expected to persist driven by growth in global population and economic activities.   * Mitigation scenarios reaching concentration levels of about 500 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 are more likely than not to limit warming to less than 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels.   * Scenarios with higher emissions in 2050 are characterized by a greater reliance on CDR technologies beyond mid-century.   * Reducing emissions of non-CO2 climate forcing agents can reduce the rate of warming in the short term but will have only a limited effect on long-term warming.   * The aggregate economic costs of mitigation vary widely depending on methodologies and assumptions but increase with the stringency of mitigation.<eos><end_of_turn>

Text: Sure, here's a summary of the main takeaways from the text with respect to the topic:  * Climate system responses to external forcing have been estimated both from climate models and from analysis of past and recent climate change.   * Cumulative emissions of CO2 largely determine global mean surface warming by the late 21st century and beyond.   * The global mean peak surface temperature change per trillion tonnes of carbon emitted as CO2 is likely in the range of 0.8°C to 2.5°C.   * Warming caused by CO2 emissions is effectively irreversible over multi-century timescales unless measures are taken to remove CO2 from the atmosphere.   * Limiting total human-induced warming to less than 2°C relative to the period 1861–1880 with a probability of >66% would require total CO2 emissions from all anthropogenic sources since 1870 to be limited to about 2900 GtCO2 when accounting for non-CO2 forcing.<eos> Sure, here's a summary of the main takeaways from the text with respect to the topic:  * Climate change risks are significantly higher when adaptation is not implemented alongside mitigation efforts.   * Mitigation and adaptation are complementary approaches that can reduce climate change impacts.   * Mitigation efforts can reduce climate change impacts over the next few decades, but some risks are unavoidable.   * The benefits of mitigation efforts are generally higher than the risks, but these benefits are not always large enough to outweigh the risks.   * The actions taken today affect the options available in the future to reduce emissions, limit temperature change and adapt to climate change.   * Short-term mitigation efforts can create, amplify or limit significant elements of lock-in that are important for decision-making.   * Irreversibilities in socio-economic and biological systems also result from climate change impacts.<eos> Sure, here are the main takeaways from the text:  * Mitigation pathways that limit warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels require substantial emissions reductions over the next few decades and near zero emissions of CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases by the end of the century.   * Implementing such reductions poses substantial technological, economic, social and institutional challenges, which increase with delays in additional mitigation and if key technologies are not available.   * Limiting warming to lower or higher levels involves similar challenges but on different timescales.   * Without additional efforts to reduce GHG emissions beyond those in place today, global emission growth is expected to persist driven by growth in global population and economic activities.   * Many different combinations of technological, behavioural and policy options can be used to reduce emissions and limit temperature change.   * Scenarios leading to CO2-eq concentrations in 2100 of about 450 ppm or lower are likely to maintain warming below 2°C over the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels.   * Limiting warming to higher levels would require similar changes but less quickly.   * Limiting warming to lower levels would require these changes more quickly.   * Scenarios that are likely to maintain warming at below 2°C include more rapid improvements in energy efficiency and a tripling to nearly a quadrupling of the share of zero- and low-carbon energy supply from renewable energy, nuclear energy and fossil energy with carbon dioxide capture and storage or BECCS by the year 2050.<eos><end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Adaptation Advantages
Text: Characteristics of adaptation pathways  Adaptation can reduce the risks of climate change impacts, but there are limits to its effectiveness, especially with greater magnitudes and rates of climate change. Taking a longer-term perspective, in the context of sustainable development, increases the likelihood that more immediate adaptation actions will also enhance future options and preparedness. Adaptation can contribute to the well-being of current and future populations, the security of assets and the maintenance of ecosystem goods, functions and services now and in the future. Adaptation is place- and context-specific, with no single approach for reducing risks appropriate across all settings . Effective risk reduction and adaptation strategies consider vulnerability and exposure and their linkages with socio-economic processes, sustainable development, and climate change. Adaptation research since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report has evolved from a dominant consideration of engineering and technological adaptation pathways to include more ecosystem-based, institutional and social measures. A previous focus on cost–benefit analysis, optimization and efficiency approaches has broadened with the development of multi-metric evaluations that include risk and uncertainty dimensions integrated within wider policy and ethical frameworks to assess tradeoffs and constraints. The range of specific adaptation measures has also expanded, as have the links to sustainable development. There are many studies on local and sectoral adaptation costs and benefits, but few global analyses and very low confidence in their results.  Adaptation planning and implementation at all levels of governance are contingent on societal values, objectives and risk perceptions. Recognition of diverse interests, circumstances, social-cultural contexts and expectations can benefit decision-making processes. Indigenous, local and traditional knowledge systems and practices, including indigenous peoples’ holistic view of community and environment, are a major resource for adapting to climate change, but these have not been used consistently in existing adaptation efforts. Integrating such forms of knowledge into practices increases the effectiveness of adaptation as do effective decision support, engagement and policy processes.  Adaptation planning and implementation can be enhanced through complementary actions across levels, from individuals to governments. National governments can coordinate adaptation efforts of local and sub-national governments, for example by protecting vulnerable groups, by supporting economic diversification and by providing information, policy and legal frameworks and financial support. Local government and the private sector are increasingly recognized as critical to progress in adaptation, given their roles in scaling up adaptation of communities, households and civil society and in managing risk information and financing.  A first step towards adaptation to future climate change is reducing vulnerability and exposure to present climate variability, but some near-term responses to climate change may also limit future choices. Integration of adaptation into planning, including policy design, and decision-making can promote synergies with development and disaster risk reduction. However, poor planning or implementation, overemphasizing short-term outcomes or failing to sufficiently anticipate consequences can result in maladaptation, increasing the vulnerability or exposure of the target group in the future or the vulnerability of other people, places or sectors. For example, enhanced protection of exposed assets can lock in dependence on further protection measures. Appropriate adaptation options can be better assessed by including co-benefits and mitigation implications.  Numerous interacting constraints can impede adaptation planning and implementation. Common constraints on implementation arise from the following: limited financial and human resources; limited integration or coordination of governance; uncertainties about projected impacts; different perceptions of risks; competing values; absence of key adaptation leaders and advocates; and limited tools to monitor adaptation effectiveness. Other constraints include insufficient research, monitoring and observation and the financial and other resources to maintain them. Underestimating the complexity of adaptation as a social process can create unrealistic expectations about achieving intended adaptation outcomes .  Greater rates and magnitude of climate change increase the likelihood of exceeding adaptation limits. Limits to adaptation occur when adaptive actions to avoid intolerable risks for an actor’s objectives or for the needs of a system are not possible or are not currently available.

Opportunities to take advantage of positive synergies between adaptation and mitigation may decrease with time, particularly if limits to adaptation are exceeded. In some parts of the world, insufficient responses to emerging impacts are already eroding the basis for sustainable development. For most regions and sectors, empirical evidence is not sufficient to quantify magnitudes of climate change that would constitute a future adaptation limit. Furthermore, economic development, technology and cultural norms and values can change over time to enhance or reduce the capacity of systems to avoid limits. As a consequence, some limits are ‘soft’ in that they may be alleviated over time. Other limits are ‘hard’ in that there are no reasonable prospects for avoiding intolerable risks.  Transformations in economic, social, technological and political decisions and actions can enhance adaptation and promote sustainable development. Restricting adaptation responses to incremental changes to existing systems and structures without considering transformational change may increase costs and losses and miss opportunities.

Transformational adaptation can include introduction of new technologies or practices, formation of new financial structures or systems of governance, adaptation at greater scales or magnitudes and shifts in the location of activities.

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Adaptation Implementation
Text: Characteristics of adaptation pathways  Adaptation can reduce the risks of climate change impacts, but there are limits to its effectiveness, especially with greater magnitudes and rates of climate change. Taking a longer-term perspective, in the context of sustainable development, increases the likelihood that more immediate adaptation actions will also enhance future options and preparedness. Adaptation can contribute to the well-being of current and future populations, the security of assets and the maintenance of ecosystem goods, functions and services now and in the future. Adaptation is place- and context-specific, with no single approach for reducing risks appropriate across all settings . Effective risk reduction and adaptation strategies consider vulnerability and exposure and their linkages with socio-economic processes, sustainable development, and climate change. Adaptation research since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report has evolved from a dominant consideration of engineering and technological adaptation pathways to include more ecosystem-based, institutional and social measures. A previous focus on cost–benefit analysis, optimization and efficiency approaches has broadened with the development of multi-metric evaluations that include risk and uncertainty dimensions integrated within wider policy and ethical frameworks to assess tradeoffs and constraints. The range of specific adaptation measures has also expanded, as have the links to sustainable development. There are many studies on local and sectoral adaptation costs and benefits, but few global analyses and very low confidence in their results.  Adaptation planning and implementation at all levels of governance are contingent on societal values, objectives and risk perceptions. Recognition of diverse interests, circumstances, social-cultural contexts and expectations can benefit decision-making processes. Indigenous, local and traditional knowledge systems and practices, including indigenous peoples’ holistic view of community and environment, are a major resource for adapting to climate change, but these have not been used consistently in existing adaptation efforts. Integrating such forms of knowledge into practices increases the effectiveness of adaptation as do effective decision support, engagement and policy processes.  Adaptation planning and implementation can be enhanced through complementary actions across levels, from individuals to governments. National governments can coordinate adaptation efforts of local and sub-national governments, for example by protecting vulnerable groups, by supporting economic diversification and by providing information, policy and legal frameworks and financial support. Local government and the private sector are increasingly recognized as critical to progress in adaptation, given their roles in scaling up adaptation of communities, households and civil society and in managing risk information and financing.  A first step towards adaptation to future climate change is reducing vulnerability and exposure to present climate variability, but some near-term responses to climate change may also limit future choices. Integration of adaptation into planning, including policy design, and decision-making can promote synergies with development and disaster risk reduction. However, poor planning or implementation, overemphasizing short-term outcomes or failing to sufficiently anticipate consequences can result in maladaptation, increasing the vulnerability or exposure of the target group in the future or the vulnerability of other people, places or sectors. For example, enhanced protection of exposed assets can lock in dependence on further protection measures. Appropriate adaptation options can be better assessed by including co-benefits and mitigation implications.  Numerous interacting constraints can impede adaptation planning and implementation. Common constraints on implementation arise from the following: limited financial and human resources; limited integration or coordination of governance; uncertainties about projected impacts; different perceptions of risks; competing values; absence of key adaptation leaders and advocates; and limited tools to monitor adaptation effectiveness. Other constraints include insufficient research, monitoring and observation and the financial and other resources to maintain them. Underestimating the complexity of adaptation as a social process can create unrealistic expectations about achieving intended adaptation outcomes .  Greater rates and magnitude of climate change increase the likelihood of exceeding adaptation limits. Limits to adaptation occur when adaptive actions to avoid intolerable risks for an actor’s objectives or for the needs of a system are not possible or are not currently available. Value-based judgments of what constitutes an intolerable risk may differ. Limits to adaptation emerge from the interaction among climate change and biophysical and/or socio-economic constraints.

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Transformational Change
Text: Characteristics of adaptation pathways  Adaptation can reduce the risks of climate change impacts, but there are limits to its effectiveness, especially with greater magnitudes and rates of climate change. Taking a longer-term perspective, in the context of sustainable development, increases the likelihood that more immediate adaptation actions will also enhance future options and preparedness. Adaptation can contribute to the well-being of current and future populations, the security of assets and the maintenance of ecosystem goods, functions and services now and in the future. Adaptation is place- and context-specific, with no single approach for reducing risks appropriate across all settings . Effective risk reduction and adaptation strategies consider vulnerability and exposure and their linkages with socio-economic processes, sustainable development, and climate change. Adaptation research since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report has evolved from a dominant consideration of engineering and technological adaptation pathways to include more ecosystem-based, institutional and social measures. A previous focus on cost–benefit analysis, optimization and efficiency approaches has broadened with the development of multi-metric evaluations that include risk and uncertainty dimensions integrated within wider policy and ethical frameworks to assess tradeoffs and constraints. The range of specific adaptation measures has also expanded, as have the links to sustainable development. There are many studies on local and sectoral adaptation costs and benefits, but few global analyses and very low confidence in their results.  Adaptation planning and implementation at all levels of governance are contingent on societal values, objectives and risk perceptions. Recognition of diverse interests, circumstances, social-cultural contexts and expectations can benefit decision-making processes. Indigenous, local and traditional knowledge systems and practices, including indigenous peoples’ holistic view of community and environment, are a major resource for adapting to climate change, but these have not been used consistently in existing adaptation efforts. Integrating such forms of knowledge into practices increases the effectiveness of adaptation as do effective decision support, engagement and policy processes.  Adaptation planning and implementation can be enhanced through complementary actions across levels, from individuals to governments. National governments can coordinate adaptation efforts of local and sub-national governments, for example by protecting vulnerable groups, by supporting economic diversification and by providing information, policy and legal frameworks and financial support. Local government and the private sector are increasingly recognized as critical to progress in adaptation, given their roles in scaling up adaptation of communities, households and civil society and in managing risk information and financing.  A first step towards adaptation to future climate change is reducing vulnerability and exposure to present climate variability, but some near-term responses to climate change may also limit future choices. Integration of adaptation into planning, including policy design, and decision-making can promote synergies with development and disaster risk reduction. However, poor planning or implementation, overemphasizing short-term outcomes or failing to sufficiently anticipate consequences can result in maladaptation, increasing the vulnerability or exposure of the target group in the future or the vulnerability of other people, places or sectors. For example, enhanced protection of exposed assets can lock in dependence on further protection measures. Appropriate adaptation options can be better assessed by including co-benefits and mitigation implications.  Numerous interacting constraints can impede adaptation planning and implementation. Common constraints on implementation arise from the following: limited financial and human resources; limited integration or coordination of governance; uncertainties about projected impacts; different perceptions of risks; competing values; absence of key adaptation leaders and advocates; and limited tools to monitor adaptation effectiveness. Other constraints include insufficient research, monitoring and observation and the financial and other resources to maintain them. Underestimating the complexity of adaptation as a social process can create unrealistic expectations about achieving intended adaptation outcomes .  Greater rates and magnitude of climate change increase the likelihood of exceeding adaptation limits. Limits to adaptation occur when adaptive actions to avoid intolerable risks for an actor’s objectives or for the needs of a system are not possible or are not currently available. Value-based judgments of what constitutes an intolerable risk may differ. Limits to adaptation emerge from the interaction among climate change and biophysical and/or socio-economic constraints. Opportunities to take advantage of positive synergies between adaptation and mitigation may decrease with time, particularly if limits to adaptation are exceeded. In some parts of the world, insufficient responses to emerging impacts are already eroding the basis for sustainable development. For most regions and sectors, empirical evidence is not sufficient to quantify magnitudes of climate change that would constitute a future adaptation limit. Furthermore, economic development, technology and cultural norms and values can change over time to enhance or reduce the capacity of systems to avoid limits. As a consequence, some limits are ‘soft’ in that they may be alleviated over time. Other limits are ‘hard’ in that there are no reasonable prospects for avoiding intolerable risks.  Transformations in economic, social, technological and political decisions and actions can enhance adaptation and promote sustainable development. Restricting adaptation responses to incremental changes to existing systems and structures without considering transformational change may increase costs and losses and miss opportunities. For example, enhancing infrastructure to protect other built assets can be expensive and ultimately not defray increasing costs and risks, whereas options such as relocation or using ecosystem services to adapt may provide a range of benefits now and in the future. Transformational adaptation can include introduction of new technologies or practices, formation of new financial structures or systems of governance, adaptation at greater scales or magnitudes and shifts in the location of activities. Planning and implementation of transformational adaptation could reflect strengthened, altered or aligned paradigms and consequently may place new and increased demands on governance structures to reconcile different goals and visions for the future and to address possible equity and ethical implications: transformational adaptation pathways are enhanced by iterative learning, deliberative processes, and innovation. At the national level, transformation is considered most effective when it reflects a country’s own visions and approaches to achieving sustainable development in accordance with its national circumstances and priorities.  Building adaptive capacity is crucial for effective selection and implementation of adaptation options . Successful adaptation requires not only identifying adaptation options and assessing their costs and benefits, but also increasing the adaptive capacity of human and natural systems . This can involve complex governance challenges and new institutions and institutional arrangements.  Significant co-benefits, synergies and trade-offs exist between mitigation and adaptation and among different adaptation responses; interactions occur both within and across regions . Increasing efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change imply an increasing complexity of interactions, particularly at the intersections among water, energy, land use and biodiversity, but tools to understand and manage these interactions remain limited. Examples of actions with co-benefits include improved energy efficiency and cleaner energy sources, leading to reduced emissions of health-damaging, climate-altering air pollutants; reduced energy and water consumption in urban areas through greening cities and recycling water; sustainable agriculture and forestry; and protection of ecosystems for carbon storage and other ecosystem services.<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Mitigation Co-benefits
Text: Mitigation  There has been a considerable increase in national and subnational mitigation plans and strategies since AR4. In 2012, 67% of global GHG emissions were subject to national legislation or strategies versus 45% in 2007. However, there has not yet been a substantial deviation in global emissions from the past trend. These plans and strategies are in their early stages of development and implementation in many countries, making it difficult to assess their aggregate impact on future global emissions.  Since AR4, there has been an increased focus on policies designed to integrate multiple objectives, increase co-benefits and reduce adverse side effects. Governments often explicitly reference co-benefits in climate and sectoral plans and strategies.  Sector-specific policies have been more widely used than economy-wide policies . Although most economic theory suggests that economy-wide policies for mitigation would be more cost-effective than sector-specific policies, administrative and political barriers may make economy-wide policies harder to design and implement than sector-specific policies. The latter may be better suited to address barriers or market failures specific to certain sectors and may be bundled in packages of complementary policies  In principle, mechanisms that set a carbon price, including cap and trade systems and carbon taxes, can achieve mitigation in a cost-effective way, but have been implemented with diverse effects due in part to national circumstances as well as policy design. The short-run environmental effects of cap and trade systems have been limited as a result of loose caps or caps that have not proved to be constraining. In some countries, tax-based policies specifically aimed at reducing GHG emissions—alongside technology and other policies—have helped to weaken the link between GHG emissions and gross domestic product . In addition, in a large group of countries, fuel taxes have had effects that are akin to sectoral carbon taxes . Revenues from carbon taxes or auctioned emission allowances are used in some countries to reduce other taxes and/or to provide transfers to low-income groups. This illustrates the general principle that mitigation policies that raise government revenue generally have lower social costs than approaches which do not.  Economic instruments in the form of subsidies may be applied across sectors, and include a variety of policy designs, such as tax rebates or exemptions, grants, loans and credit lines. An increasing number and variety of RE policies including subsidies—motivated by many factors—have driven escalated growth of RE technologies in recent years. Government policies play a crucial role in accelerating the deployment of RE technologies. Energy access and social and economic development have been the primary drivers in most developing countries whereas secure energy supply and environmental concerns have been most important in developed countries. The focus of policies is broadening from a concentration primarily on RE electricity to include RE heating and cooling and transportation.  The reduction of subsidies for GHG-related activities in various sectors can achieve emission reductions, depending on the social and economic context. While subsidies can affect emissions in many sectors, most of the recent literature has focused on subsidies for fossil fuels. Since AR4 a small but growing literature based on economy-wide models has projected that complete removal of subsidies to fossil fuels in all countries could result in reductions in global aggregate emissions by mid-century . Studies vary in methodology, the type and definition of subsidies and the time frame for phase out considered. In particular, the studies assess the impacts of complete removal of all fossil fuel subsides without seeking to assess which subsidies are wasteful and inefficient, keeping in mind national circumstances.  Regulatory approaches and information measures are widely used and are often environmentally effective . Examples of regulatory approaches include energy efficiency standards; examples of information programmes include labelling programmes that can help consumers make better-informed decisions.  Mitigation policy could devalue fossil fuel assets and reduce revenues for fossil fuel exporters, but differences between regions and fuels exist. Most mitigation scenarios are associated with reduced revenues from coal and oil trade for major exporters. The effect on natural gas export revenues is more uncertain. The availability of CCS would reduce the adverse effect of mitigation on the value of fossil fuel assets.  Interactions between or among mitigation policies may be synergistic or may have no additive effect on reducing emissions . For instance, a carbon tax can have an additive environmental effect to policies such as subsidies for the supply of RE. By contrast, if a cap and trade system has a sufficiently stringent cap to affect emission-related decisions, then other policies have no further impact on reducing emissions  . In either case, additional policies may be needed to address market failures relating to innovation and technology diffusion.  Sub-national climate policies are increasingly prevalent, both in countries with national policies and in those without. These policies include state and provincial climate plans combining market, regulatory and information instruments, and sub-national cap-and-trade systems. In addition, transnational cooperation has arisen among sub-national actors, notably among institutional investors, NGOs seeking to govern carbon offset markets, and networks of cities seeking to collaborate in generating low-carbon urban development.  Co-benefits and adverse side effects of mitigation could affect achievement of other objectives such as those related to human health, food security, biodiversity, local environmental quality, energy access, livelihoods and equitable sustainable development:  • Mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 or 500 ppm CO2-equivalent by 2100 show reduced costs for achieving air quality and energy security objectives, with significant co-benefits for human health, ecosystem impacts and sufficiency of resources and resilience of the energy system.  • Some mitigation policies raise the prices for some energy services and could hamper the ability of societies to expand access to modern energy services to underserved populations .

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Fossil Fuel
Text: Mitigation  There has been a considerable increase in national and subnational mitigation plans and strategies since AR4. In 2012, 67% of global GHG emissions were subject to national legislation or strategies versus 45% in 2007. However, there has not yet been a substantial deviation in global emissions from the past trend. These plans and strategies are in their early stages of development and implementation in many countries, making it difficult to assess their aggregate impact on future global emissions.  Since AR4, there has been an increased focus on policies designed to integrate multiple objectives, increase co-benefits and reduce adverse side effects. Governments often explicitly reference co-benefits in climate and sectoral plans and strategies.  Sector-specific policies have been more widely used than economy-wide policies . Although most economic theory suggests that economy-wide policies for mitigation would be more cost-effective than sector-specific policies, administrative and political barriers may make economy-wide policies harder to design and implement than sector-specific policies. The latter may be better suited to address barriers or market failures specific to certain sectors and may be bundled in packages of complementary policies  In principle, mechanisms that set a carbon price, including cap and trade systems and carbon taxes, can achieve mitigation in a cost-effective way, but have been implemented with diverse effects due in part to national circumstances as well as policy design. The short-run environmental effects of cap and trade systems have been limited as a result of loose caps or caps that have not proved to be constraining. In some countries, tax-based policies specifically aimed at reducing GHG emissions—alongside technology and other policies—have helped to weaken the link between GHG emissions and gross domestic product . In addition, in a large group of countries, fuel taxes have had effects that are akin to sectoral carbon taxes . Revenues from carbon taxes or auctioned emission allowances are used in some countries to reduce other taxes and/or to provide transfers to low-income groups. This illustrates the general principle that mitigation policies that raise government revenue generally have lower social costs than approaches which do not.  Economic instruments in the form of subsidies may be applied across sectors, and include a variety of policy designs, such as tax rebates or exemptions, grants, loans and credit lines.

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Enabling Mitigation and Adaptation
Text: Common enabling factors and constraints  for adaptation and mitigation responses Adaptation and mitigation responses are underpinned by common enabling factors. These include effective institutions and governance, innovation and investments in environmentally sound technologies and infrastructure, sustainable livelihoods and behavioural and lifestyle choices. Innovation and investments in environmentally sound infrastructure and technologies can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance resilience to climate change . Innovation and change can expand the availability and/ or effectiveness of adaptation and mitigation options. For example, investments in low-carbon and carbon-neutral energy technologies can reduce the energy intensity of economic development, the carbon intensity of energy, GHG emissions, and the long-term costs of mitigation. Similarly, new technologies and infrastructure can increase the resilience of human systems while reducing adverse impacts on natural systems. Investments in technology and infrastructure rely on an enabling policy environment, access to finance and technology and broader economic development that builds capacity .  Adaptation and mitigation are constrained by the inertia of global and regional trends in economic development, GHG emissions, resource consumption, infrastructure and settlement patterns, institutional behaviour and technology . Such inertia may limit the capacity to reduce GHG emissions, remain below particular climate thresholds or avoid adverse impacts. Some constraints may be overcome through new technologies, financial resources, increased institutional effectiveness and governance or changes in social and cultural attitudes and behaviours.  Vulnerability to climate change, GHG emissions, and the capacity for adaptation and mitigation are strongly influenced by livelihoods, lifestyles, behaviour and culture  . Shifts toward more energy-intensive lifestyles can contribute to higher energy and resource consumption, driving greater energy production and GHG emissions and increasing mitigation costs. In contrast, emissions can be substantially lowered through changes in consumption patterns. The social acceptability and/or effectiveness of climate policies are influenced by the extent to which they incentivize or depend on regionally appropriate changes in lifestyles or behaviours. Similarly, livelihoods that depend on climate-sensitive sectors or resources may be particularly vulnerable to climate change and climate change policies. Economic development and urbanization of landscapes exposed to climate hazards may increase the exposure of human settlements and reduce the resilience of natural systems.  For many regions and sectors, enhanced capacities to mitigate and adapt are part of the foundation essential for managing climate change risks. Such capacities are place- and context-specific and therefore there is no single approach for reducing risk that is appropriate across all settings. For example, developing nations with low income levels have the lowest financial, technological and institutional capacities to pursue low-carbon, climate-resilient development pathways. Although developed nations generally have greater relative capacity to manage the risks of climate change, such capacity does not necessarily translate into the implementation of adaptation and mitigation options.  Improving institutions as well as enhancing coordination and cooperation in governance can help overcome regional constraints associated with mitigation, adaptation and disaster risk reduction. Despite the presence of a wide array of multilateral, national and sub-national institutions focused on adaptation and mitigation, global GHG emissions continue to increase and identified adaptation needs have not been adequately addressed. The implementation of effective adaptation and mitigation options may necessitate new institutions and institutional arrangements that span multiple scales  .<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Adaptation Options
Text: Response options for adaptation  Adaptation options exist in all sectors, but their context for implementation and potential to reduce climate-related risks differs across sectors and regions. Some adaptation responses involve significant co-benefits, synergies and trade-offs. Increasing climate change will increase challenges for many adaptation options. People, governments and the private sector are starting to adapt to a changing climate. Since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report , understanding of response options has increased, with improved knowledge of their benefits, costs and links to sustainable development. Adaptation can take a variety of approaches depending on its context in vulnerability reduction, disaster risk management or proactive adaptation planning. These include : • Social, ecological asset and infrastructure development • Technological process optimization • Integrated natural resources management • Institutional, educational and behavioural change or reinforcement • Financial services, including risk transfer • Information systems to support early warning and proactive planning There is increasing recognition of the value of social , institutional, and ecosystem-based measures and of the extent of constraints to adaptation. Effective strategies and actions consider the potential for co-benefits and opportunities within wider strategic goals and development plans.  Opportunities to enable adaptation planning and implementation exist in all sectors and regions, with diverse potential and approaches depending on context. The need for adaptation along with associated challenges is expected to increase with climate change . Examples of key adaptation approaches for particular sectors, including constraints and limits, are summarized below.  Freshwater resources Adaptive water management techniques, including scenario planning, learning-based approaches and flexible and low-regret solutions, can help adjust to uncertain hydrological changes due to climate change and their impacts . Strategies include adopting integrated water management, augmenting supply, reducing the mismatch between water supply and demand, reducing non-climate stressors, strengthening institutional capacities and adopting more water-efficient technologies and water-saving strategies.  Terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems Management actions can reduce but not eliminate risks of impacts to terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems due to climate change. Actions include maintenance of genetic diversity, assisted species migration and dispersal, manipulation of disturbance regimes and reduction of other stressors. Management options that reduce non-climatic stressors, such as habitat modification, overexploitation, pollution and invasive species, increase the inherent capacity of ecosystems and their species to adapt to a changing climate. Other options include improving early warning systems and associated response systems. Enhanced connectivity of vulnerable ecosystems may also assist autonomous adaptation. Translocation of species is controversial and is expected to become less feasible where whole ecosystems are at risk.  Coastal systems and low-lying areas Increasingly, coastal adaptation options include those based on integrated coastal zone management, local community participation, ecosystems-based approaches and disaster risk reduction, mainstreamed into relevant strategies and management plans. The analysis and implementation of coastal adaptation has progressed more significantly in developed countries than in developing countries. The relative costs of coastal adaptation are expected to vary strongly among and within regions and countries.  Marine systems and oceans Marine forecasting and early warning systems as well as reducing non-climatic stressors have the potential to reduce risks for some fisheries and aquaculture industries, but options for unique ecosystems such as coral reefs are limited. Fisheries and some aquaculture industries with high-technology and/or large investments have high capacities for adaptation due to greater development of environmental monitoring, modelling and resource assessments. Adaptation options include large-scale translocation of industrial fishing activities and flexible management that can react to variability and change. For smaller-scale fisheries and nations with limited adaptive capacities, building social resilience, alternative livelihoods and occupational flexibility are important strategies. Adaptation options for coral reef systems are generally limited to reducing other stressors, mainly by enhancing water quality and limiting pressures from tourism and fishing, but their efficacy will be severely reduced as thermal stress and ocean acidification increase.  Food production system/Rural areas Adaptation options for agriculture include technological responses, enhancing smallholder access to credit and other critical production resources, strengthening institutions at local to regional levels and improving market access through trade reform. Responses to decreased food production and quality include: developing new crop varieties adapted to changes in CO2, temperature, and drought; enhancing the capacity for climate risk management; and offsetting economic impacts of land use change. Improving financial support and investing in the production of small-scale farms can also provide benefits. Expanding agricultural markets and improving the predictability and reliability of the world trading system could result in reduced market volatility and help manage food supply shortages caused by climate change.  Urban areas/Key economic sectors and services Urban adaptation benefits from effective multi-level governance, alignment of policies and incentives, strengthened local government and community adaptation capacity, synergies with the private sector and appropriate financing and institutional development. Enhancing the capacity of low-income groups and vulnerable communities and their partnerships with local governments can also be an effective urban climate adaptation strategy. Examples of adaptation mechanisms include large-scale public-private risk reduction initiatives and economic diversification and government insurance for the non-diversifiable portion of risk. In some locations, especially at the upper end of projected climate changes, responses could also require transformational changes such as managed retreat.  Human health, security and livelihoods Adaptation options that focus on strengthening existing delivery systems and institutions, as well as insurance and social protection strategies, can improve health, security and livelihoods in the near term. The most effective vulnerability reduction measures for health in the near term are programmes that implement and improve basic public health measures such as provision of clean water and sanitation, secure essential health care including vaccination and child health services, increase capacity for disaster preparedness and response and alleviate poverty. Options to address heat related mortality include health warning systems linked to response strategies, urban planning and improvements to the built environment to reduce heat stress. Robust institutions can manage many transboundary impacts of climate change to reduce risk of conflicts over shared natural resources. Insurance programmes, social protection measures and disaster risk management may enhance long-term livelihood resilience among the poor and marginalized people, if policies address multi-dimensional poverty.  Significant co-benefits, synergies and trade-offs exist between adaptation and mitigation and among different adaptation responses; interactions occur both within and across regions and sectors. For example, investments in crop varieties adapted to climate change can increase the capacity to cope with drought, and public health measures to address vector-borne diseases can enhance the capacity of health systems to address other challenges. Similarly, locating infrastructure away from low-lying coastal areas helps settlements and ecosystems adapt to sea level rise while also protecting against tsunamis. However, some adaptation options may have adverse side effects that imply real or perceived trade-offs with other adaptation objectives, mitigation objectives or broader development goals. For example, while protection of ecosystems can assist adaptation to climate change and enhance carbon storage, increased use of air conditioning to maintain thermal comfort in buildings or the use of desalination to enhance water resource security can increase energy demand, and therefore, GHG emissions.<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Need for Adaptation
Text: Response options for adaptation  Adaptation options exist in all sectors, but their context for implementation and potential to reduce climate-related risks differs across sectors and regions. Some adaptation responses involve significant co-benefits, synergies and trade-offs. Increasing climate change will increase challenges for many adaptation options. People, governments and the private sector are starting to adapt to a changing climate. Since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report , understanding of response options has increased, with improved knowledge of their benefits, costs and links to sustainable development. Adaptation can take a variety of approaches depending on its context in vulnerability reduction, disaster risk management or proactive adaptation planning. These include : • Social, ecological asset and infrastructure development • Technological process optimization • Integrated natural resources management • Institutional, educational and behavioural change or reinforcement • Financial services, including risk transfer • Information systems to support early warning and proactive planning There is increasing recognition of the value of social , institutional, and ecosystem-based measures and of the extent of constraints to adaptation. Effective strategies and actions consider the potential for co-benefits and opportunities within wider strategic goals and development plans.  Opportunities to enable adaptation planning and implementation exist in all sectors and regions, with diverse potential and approaches depending on context. The need for adaptation along with associated challenges is expected to increase with climate change . Examples of key adaptation approaches for particular sectors, including constraints and limits, are summarized below.  Freshwater resources Adaptive water management techniques, including scenario planning, learning-based approaches and flexible and low-regret solutions, can help adjust to uncertain hydrological changes due to climate change and their impacts . Strategies include adopting integrated water management, augmenting supply, reducing the mismatch between water supply and demand, reducing non-climate stressors, strengthening institutional capacities and adopting more water-efficient technologies and water-saving strategies.  Terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems Management actions can reduce but not eliminate risks of impacts to terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems due to climate change. Actions include maintenance of genetic diversity, assisted species migration and dispersal, manipulation of disturbance regimes and reduction of other stressors. Management options that reduce non-climatic stressors, such as habitat modification, overexploitation, pollution and invasive species, increase the inherent capacity of ecosystems and their species to adapt to a changing climate. Other options include improving early warning systems and associated response systems. Enhanced connectivity of vulnerable ecosystems may also assist autonomous adaptation. Translocation of species is controversial and is expected to become less feasible where whole ecosystems are at risk.  Coastal systems and low-lying areas Increasingly, coastal adaptation options include those based on integrated coastal zone management, local community participation, ecosystems-based approaches and disaster risk reduction, mainstreamed into relevant strategies and management plans. The analysis and implementation of coastal adaptation has progressed more significantly in developed countries than in developing countries. The relative costs of coastal adaptation are expected to vary strongly among and within regions and countries.  Marine systems and oceans Marine forecasting and early warning systems as well as reducing non-climatic stressors have the potential to reduce risks for some fisheries and aquaculture industries, but options for unique ecosystems such as coral reefs are limited. Fisheries and some aquaculture industries with high-technology and/or large investments have high capacities for adaptation due to greater development of environmental monitoring, modelling and resource assessments. Adaptation options include large-scale translocation of industrial fishing activities and flexible management that can react to variability and change. For smaller-scale fisheries and nations with limited adaptive capacities, building social resilience, alternative livelihoods and occupational flexibility are important strategies. Adaptation options for coral reef systems are generally limited to reducing other stressors, mainly by enhancing water quality and limiting pressures from tourism and fishing, but their efficacy will be severely reduced as thermal stress and ocean acidification increase.  Food production system/Rural areas Adaptation options for agriculture include technological responses, enhancing smallholder access to credit and other critical production resources, strengthening institutions at local to regional levels and improving market access through trade reform. Responses to decreased food production and quality include: developing new crop varieties adapted to changes in CO2, temperature, and drought; enhancing the capacity for climate risk management; and offsetting economic impacts of land use change. Improving financial support and investing in the production of small-scale farms can also provide benefits. Expanding agricultural markets and improving the predictability and reliability of the world trading system could result in reduced market volatility and help manage food supply shortages caused by climate change.  Urban areas/Key economic sectors and services Urban adaptation benefits from effective multi-level governance, alignment of policies and incentives, strengthened local government and community adaptation capacity, synergies with the private sector and appropriate financing and institutional development. Enhancing the capacity of low-income groups and vulnerable communities and their partnerships with local governments can also be an effective urban climate adaptation strategy. Examples of adaptation mechanisms include large-scale public-private risk reduction initiatives and economic diversification and government insurance for the non-diversifiable portion of risk. In some locations, especially at the upper end of projected climate changes, responses could also require transformational changes such as managed retreat.  Human health, security and livelihoods Adaptation options that focus on strengthening existing delivery systems and institutions, as well as insurance and social protection strategies, can improve health, security and livelihoods in the near term. The most effective vulnerability reduction measures for health in the near term are programmes that implement and improve basic public health measures such as provision of clean water and sanitation, secure essential health care including vaccination and child health services, increase capacity for disaster preparedness and response and alleviate poverty. Options to address heat related mortality include health warning systems linked to response strategies, urban planning and improvements to the built environment to reduce heat stress. Robust institutions can manage many transboundary impacts of climate change to reduce risk of conflicts over shared natural resources. Insurance programmes, social protection measures and disaster risk management may enhance long-term livelihood resilience among the poor and marginalized people, if policies address multi-dimensional poverty.  Significant co-benefits, synergies and trade-offs exist between adaptation and mitigation and among different adaptation responses; interactions occur both within and across regions and sectors. For example, investments in crop varieties adapted to climate change can increase the capacity to cope with drought, and public health measures to address vector-borne diseases can enhance the capacity of health systems to address other challenges. Similarly, locating infrastructure away from low-lying coastal areas helps settlements and ecosystems adapt to sea level rise while also protecting against tsunamis. However, some adaptation options may have adverse side effects that imply real or perceived trade-offs with other adaptation objectives, mitigation objectives or broader development goals. For example, while protection of ecosystems can assist adaptation to climate change and enhance carbon storage, increased use of air conditioning to maintain thermal comfort in buildings or the use of desalination to enhance water resource security can increase energy demand, and therefore, GHG emissions.<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Mitigation Options
Text: Response options for mitigation  Mitigation options are available in every major sector. Mitigation can be more cost-effective if using an integrated approach that combines measures to reduce energy use and the greenhouse gas intensity of end-use sectors, decarbonize energy supply, reduce net emissions and enhance carbon sinks in land-based sectors. A broad range of sectoral mitigation options is available that can reduce GHG emission intensity, improve energy intensity through enhancements of technology, behaviour, production and resource efficiency and enable structural changes or changes in activity. In addition, direct options in agriculture, forestry and other land use involve reducing CO2 emissions by reducing deforestation, forest degradation and forest fires; storing carbon in terrestrial systems; and providing bioenergy feedstocks. Options to reduce non-CO2 emissions exist across all sectors but most notably in agriculture, energy supply and industry. An overview of sectoral mitigation options and potentials is provided in Table 4.4.  Well-designed systemic and cross-sectoral mitigation strategies are more cost-effective in cutting emissions than a focus on individual technologies and sectors with efforts in one sector affecting the need for mitigation in others . In baseline scenarios without new mitigation policies, GHG emissions are projected to grow in all sectors, except for net CO2 emissions in the AFOLU sector. Mitigation scenarios reaching around 450 ppm CO2-eq concentration by 21004328 show largescale global changes in the energy supply sector . While rapid decarbonization of energy supply generally entails more flexibility for end-use and AFOLU sectors, stronger demand reductions lessen the mitigation challenge for the supply side of the energy system. There are thus strong interdependencies across sectors and the resulting distribution of the mitigation effort is strongly influenced by the availability and performance of future technologies, particularly BECCS and large scale afforestation . The next two decades present a window of opportunity for mitigation in urban areas, as a large portion of the world’s urban areas will be developed during this period.  Decarbonizing electricity generation is a key component of cost-effective mitigation strategies in achieving low stabilization levels  . In most integrated modelling scenarios, decarbonization happens more rapidly in electricity generation than in the industry, buildings and transport sectors. In scenarios reaching 450 ppm CO2-eq concentrations by 2100, global CO2 emissions from the energy supply sector are projected to decline over the next decade and are characterized by reductions of 90% or more below 2010 levels between 2040 and 2070.  Efficiency enhancements and behavioural changes, in order to reduce energy demand compared to baseline scenarios without compromising development, are a key mitigation strategy in scenarios reaching atmospheric CO2-eq concentrations of about 450 to about 500 ppm by 2100 . Near-term reductions in energy demand are an important element of cost-effective mitigation strategies, provide more flexibility for reducing carbon intensity in the energy supply sector, hedge against related supply-side risks, avoid lock-in to carbon-intensive infrastructures and are associated with important co-benefits . Emissions can be substantially lowered through changes in consumption patterns  and dietary change and reduction in food wastes. A number of options including monetary and non-monetary incentives as well as information measures may facilitate behavioural changes.  Decarbonization of the energy supply sector  requires upscaling of low- and zero-carbon electricity generation technologies. In the majority of low-concentration stabilization scenarios , the share of low-carbon electricity supply, nuclear and CCS, including BECCS) increases from the current share of approximately 30% to more than 80% by 2050 and 90% by 2100, and fossil fuel power generation without CCS is phased out almost entirely by 2100. Among these low-carbon technologies, a growing number of RE technologies have achieved a level of maturity to enable deployment at significant scale since AR4 and nuclear energy is a mature low-GHG emission source of baseload power, but its share of global electricity generation has been declining. GHG emissions from energy supply can be reduced significantly by replacing current world average coal-fired power plants with modern, highly efficient natural gas combined-cycle power plants or combined heat and power plants, provided that natural gas is available and the fugitive emissions associated with extraction and supply are low or mitigated.  Behaviour, lifestyle and culture have a considerable influence on energy use and associated emissions, with high mitigation potential in some sectors, in particular when complementing technological and structural change . In the transport sector, technical and behavioural mitigation measures for all modes, plus new infrastructure and urban redevelopment investments, could reduce final energy demand significantly below baseline levels. While opportunities for switching to low-carbon fuels exist, the rate of decarbonization in the transport sector might be constrained by challenges associated with energy storage and the relatively low energy density of low-carbon transport fuels. In the building sector, recent advances in technologies, know-how and policies provide opportunities to stabilize or reduce global energy use to about current levels by mid-century. In addition, recent improvements in performance and costs make very low energy construction and retrofits of buildings economically attractive, sometimes even at net negative costs. In the industry sector, improvements in GHG emission efficiency and in the efficiency of material use, recycling and reuse of materials and products, and overall reductions in product demand  and service demand could, in addition to energy efficiency, help reduce GHG emissions below the baseline level. Prevalent approaches for promoting energy efficiency in industry include information programmes followed by economic instruments, regulatory approaches and voluntary actions. Important options for mitigation in waste management are waste reduction, followed by re-use, recycling and energy recovery.  The most cost-effective mitigation options in forestry are afforestation, sustainable forest management and reducing deforestation, with large differences in their relative importance across regions. In agriculture, the most cost-effective mitigation options are cropland management, grazing land management and restoration of organic soils . About a third of mitigation potential in forestry can be achieved at a cost <20 USD/tCO2-eq emission. Demand-side measures, such as changes in diet and reductions of losses in the food supply chain, have a significant, but uncertain, potential to reduce GHG emissions from food production .  Bioenergy can play a critical role for mitigation, but there are issues to consider, such as the sustainability of practices and the efficiency of bioenergy systems . Evidence suggests that bioenergy options with low lifecycle emissions, some already available, can reduce GHG emissions; outcomes are site-specific and rely on efficient integrated ‘biomassto-bioenergy systems’, and sustainable land use management and governance. Barriers to large-scale deployment of bioenergy include concerns about GHG emissions from land, food security, water resources, biodiversity conservation and livelihoods.  Mitigation measures intersect with other societal goals, creating the possibility of co-benefits or adverse side-effects. These intersections, if well-managed, can strengthen the basis for undertaking climate mitigation actions . Mitigation can positively or negatively influence the achievement of other societal goals, such as those related to human health, food security, biodiversity, local environmental quality, energy access, livelihoods and equitable sustainable development . On the other hand, policies towards other societal goals can influence the achievement of mitigation and adaptation objectives. These influences can be substantial, although sometimes difficult to quantify, especially in welfare terms. This multi-objective perspective is important in part because it helps to identify areas where support for policies that advance multiple goals will be robust. Potential co-benefits and adverse side effects of the main sectoral mitigation measures are summarized in Table 4.5. Overall, the potential for co-benefits for energy end-use measures outweigh the potential for adverse side effects, whereas the evidence suggests this may not be the case for all energy supply and AFOLU measures.<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: International Cooperation
Text: International and regional cooperation  on adaptation and mitigation Because climate change has the characteristics of a collective action problem at the global scale, effective mitigation will not be achieved if individual agents advance their own interests independently, even though mitigation can also have local co-benefits. Cooperative responses, including international cooperation, are therefore required to effectively mitigate GHG emissions and address other climate change issues. While adaptation focuses primarily on local to national scale outcomes, its effectiveness can be enhanced through coordination across governance scales, including international cooperation. In fact, international cooperation has helped to facilitate the creation of adaptation strategies, plans, and actions at national, sub-national, and local levels. A variety of climate policy instruments have been employed, and even more could be employed, at international and regional levels to address mitigation and to support and promote adaptation at national and sub-national scales. Evidence suggests that outcomes seen as equitable can lead to more effective cooperation.  The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is the main multilateral forum focused on addressing climate change, with nearly universal participation. UNFCCC activities since 2007, which include the 2010 Cancún Agreements and the 2011 Durban Platform for Enhanced Action, have sought to enhance actions under the Convention, and have led to an increasing number of institutions and other arrangements for international climate change cooperation. Other institutions organized at different levels of governance have resulted in diversifying international climate change cooperation.  Existing and proposed international climate change cooperation arrangements vary in their focus and degree of centralization and coordination. They span: multilateral agreements, harmonized national policies and decentralized but coordinated national policies, as well as regional and regionally-coordinated policies .  While a number of new institutions are focused on adaptation funding and coordination, adaptation has historically received less attention than mitigation in international climate policy . Inclusion of adaptation is increasingly important to reduce the risk from climate change impacts and may engage a greater number of countries.  The Kyoto Protocol offers lessons towards achieving the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC, particularly with respect to participation, implementation, flexibility mechanisms, and environmental effectiveness. The Protocol was the first binding step toward implementing the principles and goals provided by the UNFCCC. According to national GHG inventories through 2012 submitted to the UNFCCC by October 2013, Annex B Parties with quantified emission limitations  in aggregate may have bettered their collective emission reduction target in the first commitment period, but some emissions reductions that would have occurred even in its absence were also counted. The Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism created a market for emissions offsets from developing countries, the purpose being two-fold: to help Annex I countries fulfill their commitments and to assist non-Annex I countries achieve sustainable development. The CDM generated Certified Emission Reductions equivalent to emissions of over 1.4 GtCO2-eqby October 2013, led to significant project investments, and generated investment flows for a variety of functions, including the UNFCCC Adaptation Fund. However, its environmental effectiveness has been questioned by some, particularly in regard to its early years, due to concerns about the additionality of projects , the validity of baselines, and the possibility of emissions leakage . Such concerns about additionality are common to any emission-reduction-credit program, and are not specific to the CDM. Due to market forces, the majority of single CDM projects have been concentrated in a limited number of countries, while Programmes of Activities, though less frequent, have been more evenly distributed. In addition, the Kyoto Protocol created two other ‘flexibility mechanisms’: Joint Implementation and International Emissions Trading.  Several conceptual models for effort-sharing have been identified in research. However, realized distributional impacts from actual international cooperative agreements depend not only on the approach taken but also on criteria applied to operationalize equity and the manner in which developing countries’ emissions reduction plans are financed.  Policy linkages among regional, national and sub-national climate policies offer potential climate change mitigation benefits. Linkages have been established between carbon markets and in principle could also be established between and among a heterogeneous set of policy instruments including non-market-based policies, such as performance standards. Potential advantages include lower mitigation costs, decreased emission leakage and increased market liquidity.  Regional initiatives between national and global scales are being developed and implemented, but their impact on global mitigation has been limited to date. Some climate policies could be more environmentally and economically effective if implemented across broad regions, such as by embodying mitigation objectives in trade agreements or jointly constructing infrastructures that facilitate reduction in carbon emissions.  International cooperation for supporting adaptation planning and implementation has assisted in the creation of adaptation strategies, plans and actions at national, sub-national and local levels. For example, a range of multilateral and regionally targeted funding mechanisms have been established for adaptation; UN agencies, international development organizations and non-governmental organisations have provided information, methodologies and guidelines; and global and regional initiatives supported and promoted the creation of national adaptation strategies in both developing and developed countries. Closer integration of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation at the international level, and the mainstreaming of both into international development assistance, may foster greater efficiency in the use of resources and capacity. However, stronger efforts at the international level do not necessarily lead to substantive and rapid results at the local level.<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Carbon Tax
Text: Mitigation  There has been a considerable increase in national and subnational mitigation plans and strategies since AR4. In 2012, 67% of global GHG emissions were subject to national legislation or strategies versus 45% in 2007. However, there has not yet been a substantial deviation in global emissions from the past trend. These plans and strategies are in their early stages of development and implementation in many countries, making it difficult to assess their aggregate impact on future global emissions.  Since AR4, there has been an increased focus on policies designed to integrate multiple objectives, increase co-benefits and reduce adverse side effects. Governments often explicitly reference co-benefits in climate and sectoral plans and strategies.  Sector-specific policies have been more widely used than economy-wide policies . Although most economic theory suggests that economy-wide policies for mitigation would be more cost-effective than sector-specific policies, administrative and political barriers may make economy-wide policies harder to design and implement than sector-specific policies. The latter may be better suited to address barriers or market failures specific to certain sectors and may be bundled in packages of complementary policies  In principle, mechanisms that set a carbon price, including cap and trade systems and carbon taxes, can achieve mitigation in a cost-effective way, but have been implemented with diverse effects due in part to national circumstances as well as policy design. The short-run environmental effects of cap and trade systems have been limited as a result of loose caps or caps that have not proved to be constraining. In some countries, tax-based policies specifically aimed at reducing GHG emissions—alongside technology and other policies—have helped to weaken the link between GHG emissions and gross domestic product . In addition, in a large group of countries, fuel taxes have had effects that are akin to sectoral carbon taxes . Revenues from carbon taxes or auctioned emission allowances are used in some countries to reduce other taxes and/or to provide transfers to low-income groups. This illustrates the general principle that mitigation policies that raise government revenue generally have lower social costs than approaches which do not.  Economic instruments in the form of subsidies may be applied across sectors, and include a variety of policy designs, such as tax rebates or exemptions, grants, loans and credit lines. An increasing number and variety of RE policies including subsidies—motivated by many factors—have driven escalated growth of RE technologies in recent years. Government policies play a crucial role in accelerating the deployment of RE technologies. Energy access and social and economic development have been the primary drivers in most developing countries whereas secure energy supply and environmental concerns have been most important in developed countries. The focus of policies is broadening from a concentration primarily on RE electricity to include RE heating and cooling and transportation.  The reduction of subsidies for GHG-related activities in various sectors can achieve emission reductions, depending on the social and economic context. While subsidies can affect emissions in many sectors, most of the recent literature has focused on subsidies for fossil fuels. Since AR4 a small but growing literature based on economy-wide models has projected that complete removal of subsidies to fossil fuels in all countries could result in reductions in global aggregate emissions by mid-century . Studies vary in methodology, the type and definition of subsidies and the time frame for phase out considered. In particular, the studies assess the impacts of complete removal of all fossil fuel subsides without seeking to assess which subsidies are wasteful and inefficient, keeping in mind national circumstances.  Regulatory approaches and information measures are widely used and are often environmentally effective . Examples of regulatory approaches include energy efficiency standards; examples of information programmes include labelling programmes that can help consumers make better-informed decisions.  Mitigation policy could devalue fossil fuel assets and reduce revenues for fossil fuel exporters, but differences between regions and fuels exist. Most mitigation scenarios are associated with reduced revenues from coal and oil trade for major exporters. The effect on natural gas export revenues is more uncertain. The availability of CCS would reduce the adverse effect of mitigation on the value of fossil fuel assets.  Interactions between or among mitigation policies may be synergistic or may have no additive effect on reducing emissions . For instance, a carbon tax can have an additive environmental effect to policies such as subsidies for the supply of RE. By contrast, if a cap and trade system has a sufficiently stringent cap to affect emission-related decisions, then other policies have no further impact on reducing emissions  . In either case, additional policies may be needed to address market failures relating to innovation and technology diffusion.  Sub-national climate policies are increasingly prevalent, both in countries with national policies and in those without. These policies include state and provincial climate plans combining market, regulatory and information instruments, and sub-national cap-and-trade systems. In addition, transnational cooperation has arisen among sub-national actors, notably among institutional investors, NGOs seeking to govern carbon offset markets, and networks of cities seeking to collaborate in generating low-carbon urban development.  Co-benefits and adverse side effects of mitigation could affect achievement of other objectives such as those related to human health, food security, biodiversity, local environmental quality, energy access, livelihoods and equitable sustainable development:  • Mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 or 500 ppm CO2-equivalent by 2100 show reduced costs for achieving air quality and energy security objectives, with significant co-benefits for human health, ecosystem impacts and sufficiency of resources and resilience of the energy system.  • Some mitigation policies raise the prices for some energy services and could hamper the ability of societies to expand access to modern energy services to underserved populations . These potential adverse side effects can be avoided with the adoption of complementary policies such as income tax rebates or other benefit transfer mechanisms. The costs of achieving nearly universal access to electricity and clean fuels for cooking and heating are projected to be between USD 72 to 95 billion per year until 2030 with minimal effects on GHG emissions and multiple benefits in health and air pollutant reduction.  Whether or not side effects materialize, and to what extent side effects materialize, will be case- and site-specific, and depend on local circumstances and the scale, scope and pace of implementation. Many co-benefits and adverse side effects have not been well-quantified.<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Technological Solutions
Text: Technology development and transfer  Technology policy complements other mitigation policies across all scales from international to sub-national, but worldwide investment in research in support of GHG mitigation is small relative to overall public research spending. Technology policy includes technology-push and demand-pull . Such policies address a pervasive market failure because, in the absence of government policy such as patent protection, the invention of new technologies and practices from R&D efforts has aspects of a public good and thus tends to be under-provided by market forces alone. Technology support policies have promoted substantial innovation and diffusion of new technologies, but the cost-effectiveness of such policies is often difficult to assess. Technology policy can increase incentives for participation and compliance with international cooperative efforts, particularly in the long run.  Many adaptation efforts also critically rely on diffusion and transfer of technologies and management practices, but their effective use depends on a suitable institutional, regulatory, social and cultural context. Adaptation technologies are often familiar and already applied elsewhere. However, the success of technology transfer may involve not only the provision of finance and information, but also strengthening of policy and regulatory environments and capacities to absorb, employ and improve technologies appropriate to local circumstances.<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Financial Solutions
Text: Investment and finance  Substantial reductions in emissions would require large changes in investment patterns. Mitigation scenarios in which policies stabilize atmospheric concentrations  in the range from 430 to 530 ppm CO2-eq by 21004530 lead to substantial shifts in annual investment flows during the period 2010–2029 compared to baseline scenarios. Over the next two decades , annual investments in conventional fossil fuel technologies associated with the electricity supply sector are projected to decline in the scenarios by about USD 30 billion  while annual investment in low carbon electricity supply is projected to rise in the scenarios by about USD 147 billion  . In addition, annual incremental energy efficiency investments in transport, industry and buildings is projected to rise in the scenarios by about USD 336 billion. Global total annual investment in the energy system is presently about USD 1, billion. This number includes only energy supply of electricity and heat and respective upstream and downstream activities. Energy efficiency investment or underlying sector investment is not included.  There is no widely agreed definition of what constitutes climate finance, but estimates of the financial flows associated with climate change mitigation and adaptation are available. See Figure 4.5 for an overview of climate finance flows. Published assessments of all current annual financial flows whose expected effect is to reduce net GHG emissions and/or to enhance resilience to climate change and climate variability show USD 343 to 385 billion per year globally. Out of this, total public climate finance that flowed to developing countries is estimated to be between USD 35 and 49 billion per year in 2011 and 2012. Estimates of international private climate finance flowing to developing countries range from USD 10 to 72 billion per year including foreign direct investment as equity and loans in the range of USD 10 to 37 billion per year over the period of 2008–2011.  In many countries, the private sector plays central roles in the processes that lead to emissions as well as to mitigation and adaptation. Within appropriate enabling environments, the private sector, along with the public sector, can play an important role in financing mitigation and adaptation . The share of total mitigation finance from the private sector, acknowledging data limitations, is estimated to be on average between two-thirds and three-fourths on the global level . In many countries, public finance interventions by governments and international development banks encourage climate investments by the private sector and provide finance where private sector investment is limited. The quality of a country’s enabling environment includes the effectiveness of its institutions, regulations and guidelines regarding the private sector, security of property rights, credibility of policies and other factors that have a substantial impact on whether private firms invest in new technologies and infrastructures. Dedicated policy instruments and financial arrangements, for example, credit insurance, feed-in tariffs, concessional finance or rebates provide an incentive for mitigation investment by improving the return adjusted for the risk for private actors. Public-private risk reduction initiatives  and economic diversification are examples of adaptation action enabling and relying on private sector participation.  Financial resources for adaptation have become available more slowly than for mitigation in both developed and developing countries. Limited evidence indicates that there is a gap between global adaptation needs and the funds available for adaptation. Potential synergies between international finance for disaster risk management and adaptation to climate change have not yet been fully realized. There is a need for better assessment of global adaptation costs, funding and investment. Studies estimating the global cost of adaptation are characterized by shortcomings in data, methods and coverage .<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Climate Change Projections
Text: Interaction among mitigation, adaptation  and sustainable development Climate change is a threat to equitable and sustainable development. Adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development are closely related, with potential for synergies and trade-offs. Climate change poses an increasing threat to equitable and sustainable development. Some climate-related impacts on development are already being observed. Climate change is a threat multiplier. It exacerbates other threats to social and natural systems, placing additional burdens particularly on the poor and constraining possible development paths for all. Development along current global pathways can contribute to climate risk and vulnerability, further eroding the basis for sustainable development.  Aligning climate policy with sustainable development requires attention to both adaptation and mitigation. Interaction among adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development occurs both within and across regions and scales, often in the context of multiple stressors. Some options for responding to climate change could impose risks of other environmental and social costs, have adverse distributional effects and draw resources away from other development priorities, including poverty eradication.  Both adaptation and mitigation can bring substantial co-benefits . Examples of actions with co-benefits include improved air quality; enhanced energy security, reduced energy and water consumption in urban areas through greening cities and recycling water; sustainable agriculture and forestry; and protection of ecosystems for carbon storage and other ecosystem services.  Strategies and actions can be pursued now that will move towards climate-resilient pathways for sustainable development, while at the same time helping to improve livelihoods, social and economic well-being and effective environmental management. Prospects for climate-resilient pathways are related fundamentally to what the world accomplishes with climate change mitigation. Since mitigation reduces the rate as well as the magnitude of warming, it also increases the time available for adaptation to a particular level of climate change, potentially by several decades. Delaying mitigation actions may reduce options for climate-resilient pathways in the future. Trade-offs, synergies and integrated responses  There are many opportunities to link mitigation, adaptation and the pursuit of other societal objectives through integrated responses. Successful implementation relies on relevant tools, suitable governance structures and enhanced capacity to respond. A growing evidence base indicates close links between adaptation and mitigation, their co-benefits and adverse side effects, and recognizes sustainable development as the overarching context for climate policy . Developing tools to address these linkages is critical to the success of climate policy in the context of sustainable development. This section presents examples of integrated responses in specific policy arenas, as well as some of the factors that promote or impede policies aimed at multiple objectives. Increasing efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change imply an increasing complexity of interactions, encompassing connections among human health, water, energy, land use and biodiversity. Mitigation can support the achievement of other societal goals, such as those related to human health, food security, environmental quality, energy access, livelihoods and sustainable development, although there can also be negative effects. Adaptation measures also have the potential to deliver mitigation co-benefits, and vice versa, and support other societal goals, though trade-offs can also arise.  Integration of adaptation and mitigation into planning and decision-making can create synergies with sustainable development. Synergies and trade-offs among mitigation and adaptation policies and policies advancing other societal goals can be substantial, although sometimes difficult to quantify especially in welfare terms. A multi-objective approach to policy-making can help manage these synergies and trade-offs. Policies advancing multiple goals may also attract greater support.  Effective integrated responses depend on suitable tools and governance structures, as well as adequate capacity . Managing trade-offs and synergies is challenging and requires tools to help understand interactions and support decision-making at local and regional scales. Integrated responses also depend on governance that enables coordination across scales and sectors, supported by appropriate institutions. Developing and implementing suitable tools and governance structures often requires upgrading the human and institutional capacity to design and deploy integrated responses.  An integrated approach to energy planning and implementation that explicitly assesses the potential for co-benefits and the presence of adverse side effects can capture complementarities across multiple climate, social and environmental objectives . There are strong interactive effects across various energy policy objectives, such as energy security, air quality, health and energy access and between a range of social and environmental objectives and climate mitigation objectives . An integrated approach can be assisted by tools such as cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, multi-criteria analysis and expected utility theory. It also requires appropriate coordinating institutions.  Explicit consideration of interactions among water, food, energy and biological carbon sequestration plays an important role in supporting effective decisions for climate resilient pathways . Both biofuel-based power generation and large-scale afforestation designed to mitigate climate change can reduce catchment run-off, which may conflict with alternative water uses for food production, human consumption or the maintenance of ecosystem function and services. Conversely, irrigation can increase the climate resilience of food and fibre production but reduces water availability for other uses.  An integrated response to urbanization provides substantial opportunities for enhanced resilience, reduced emissions and more sustainable development. Urban areas account for more than half of global primary energy use and energy-related CO2 emissions and contain a high proportion of the population and economic activities at risk from climate change. In rapidly growing and urbanizing regions, mitigation strategies based on spatial planning and efficient infrastructure supply can avoid the lock-in of high emission patterns. Mixed-use zoning, transport-oriented development, increased density and co-located jobs and homes can reduce direct and indirect energy use across sectors. Compact development of urban spaces and intelligent densification can preserve land carbon stocks and land for agriculture and bioenergy. Reduced energy and water consumption in urban areas through greening cities and recycling water are examples of mitigation actions with adaptation benefits. Building resilient infrastructure systems can reduce vulnerability of urban settlements and cities to coastal flooding, sea level rise and other climate-induced stresses.<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Global Surface Temperature
Text: Observed Warming and its Causes  Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020 64, with larger increases over land than over the ocean 65 . Observed warming is human-caused, with warming from greenhouse gases, dominated by CO2 and methane, partly masked by aerosol cooling. Global surface temperature in the first two decades of the 21st century was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2000 years. The likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs 67 contributed a warming of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal variability changed it by ±0.2°C.  Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion of CO2 emissions from human activities over the past six decades, with regional differences. In 2019, atmospheric CO2 concentrations reached 410 parts per million, CH 4 reached 1866 parts per billion and nitrous oxide reached 332 ppb. Other major contributors to warming are tropospheric ozone and halogenated gases. Concentrations of CH 4 and N2 O have increased to levels unprecedented in at least 800, years, and there is high confidence that current CO 2 concentrations are higher than at any time over at least the past two million years. Since 1750, increases in CO 2 and CH4 concentrations far exceed – and increases in N2 O are similar to – the natural multi-millennial changes between glacial and interglacial periods over at least the past 800, years. The net cooling effect which arises from anthropogenic aerosols peaked in the late 20th century .  Average annual GHG emissions during 2010–2019 were higher than in any previous decade, but the rate of growth between 2010 and 2019 was lower than that between 2000 and 2009  69 . Historical cumulative net CO 2 emissions from 1850 to 2019 were 2400 ±240 GtCO2. Of these, more than half occurred between 1850 and 1989 [1400 ±195 GtCO 2], and about 42% between 1990 and 2019 [1000 ±90 GtCO2]. Global net anthropogenic GHG emissions have been estimated to be 59±6.6 GtCO 2 -eq in 2019, about 12% higher than in 2010 and 54% higher than in 1990. By 2019, the largest growth in gross emissions occurred in CO2 from fossil fuels and industry followed by CH4, whereas the highest relative growth occurred in fluorinated gases, starting from low levels in 1990.  Regional contributions to global human-caused GHG emissions continue to differ widely. Historical contributions of CO2 emissions vary substantially across regions in terms of total magnitude, but also in terms of contributions to CO 2 -FFI and net CO2 -LULUCF emissions. Variations in regional and national per capita emissions partly reflect different development stages, but they also vary widely at similar income levels. Average per capita net anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2019 ranged from 2.6 tCO 2-eq to 19 tCO 2-eq across regions. Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States have much lower per capita emissions  than the global average, excluding CO2 -LULUCF. Around 48% of the global population in 2019 lives in countries emitting on average more than 6 tCO 2-eq per capita, 35% of the global population live in countries emitting more than 9 tCO2 -eq per capita while another 41% live in countries emitting less than 3 tCO 2 -eq per capita. A substantial share of the population in these low-emitting countries lack access to modern energy services.  Net GHG emissions have increased since 2010 across all major sectors. In 2019, approximately 34% of net global GHG emissions came from the energy sector, 24% from industry, 22% from AFOLU, 15% from transport and 6% from buildings . Average annual GHG emissions growth between 2010 and 2019 slowed compared to the previous decade in energy supply and industry but remained roughly constant at about 2% yr –1 in the transport sector . About half of total net AFOLU emissions are from CO2 LULUCF, predominantly from deforestation. Land overall constituted a net sink of –6.6 GtCO 2 yr–1 for the period 2010–201972.  Human-caused climate change is a consequence of more than a century of net GHG emissions from energy use, land-use and land use change, lifestyle and patterns of consumption, and production. Emissions reductions in CO2 from fossil fuels and industrial processes, due to improvements in energy intensity of GDP and carbon intensity of energy, have been less than emissions increases from rising global activity levels in industry, energy supply, transport, agriculture and buildings. The 10% of households with the highest per capita emissions contribute 34–45% of global consumption-based household GHG emissions, while the middle 40% contribute 40–53%, and the bottom 50% contribute 13–15%. An increasing share of emissions can be attributed to urban areas . The drivers of urban GHG emissions 73 are complex and include population size, income, state of urbanisation and urban form.<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: CO2 Emissions
Text: Observed Warming and its Causes  Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020 64, with larger increases over land than over the ocean 65 . Observed warming is human-caused, with warming from greenhouse gases, dominated by CO2 and methane, partly masked by aerosol cooling. Global surface temperature in the first two decades of the 21st century was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2000 years. The likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs 67 contributed a warming of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal variability changed it by ±0.2°C.  Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion of CO2 emissions from human activities over the past six decades, with regional differences. In 2019, atmospheric CO2 concentrations reached 410 parts per million, CH 4 reached 1866 parts per billion and nitrous oxide reached 332 ppb. Other major contributors to warming are tropospheric ozone and halogenated gases. Concentrations of CH 4 and N2 O have increased to levels unprecedented in at least 800, years, and there is high confidence that current CO 2 concentrations are higher than at any time over at least the past two million years. Since 1750, increases in CO 2 and CH4 concentrations far exceed – and increases in N2 O are similar to – the natural multi-millennial changes between glacial and interglacial periods over at least the past 800, years. The net cooling effect which arises from anthropogenic aerosols peaked in the late 20th century .  Average annual GHG emissions during 2010–2019 were higher than in any previous decade, but the rate of growth between 2010 and 2019 was lower than that between 2000 and 2009  69 . Historical cumulative net CO 2 emissions from 1850 to 2019 were 2400 ±240 GtCO2. Of these, more than half occurred between 1850 and 1989 [1400 ±195 GtCO 2], and about 42% between 1990 and 2019 [1000 ±90 GtCO2]. Global net anthropogenic GHG emissions have been estimated to be 59±6.6 GtCO 2 -eq in 2019, about 12% higher than in 2010 and 54% higher than in 1990. By 2019, the largest growth in gross emissions occurred in CO2 from fossil fuels and industry followed by CH4, whereas the highest relative growth occurred in fluorinated gases, starting from low levels in 1990.  Regional contributions to global human-caused GHG emissions continue to differ widely. Historical contributions of CO2 emissions vary substantially across regions in terms of total magnitude, but also in terms of contributions to CO 2 -FFI and net CO2 -LULUCF emissions. Variations in regional and national per capita emissions partly reflect different development stages, but they also vary widely at similar income levels. Average per capita net anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2019 ranged from 2.6 tCO 2-eq to 19 tCO 2-eq across regions. Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States have much lower per capita emissions  than the global average, excluding CO2 -LULUCF. Around 48% of the global population in 2019 lives in countries emitting on average more than 6 tCO 2-eq per capita, 35% of the global population live in countries emitting more than 9 tCO2 -eq per capita while another 41% live in countries emitting less than 3 tCO 2 -eq per capita. A substantial share of the population in these low-emitting countries lack access to modern energy services.  Net GHG emissions have increased since 2010 across all major sectors. In 2019, approximately 34% of net global GHG emissions came from the energy sector, 24% from industry, 22% from AFOLU, 15% from transport and 6% from buildings . Average annual GHG emissions growth between 2010 and 2019 slowed compared to the previous decade in energy supply and industry but remained roughly constant at about 2% yr –1 in the transport sector . About half of total net AFOLU emissions are from CO2 LULUCF, predominantly from deforestation. Land overall constituted a net sink of –6.6 GtCO 2 yr–1 for the period 2010–201972.  Human-caused climate change is a consequence of more than a century of net GHG emissions from energy use, land-use and land use change, lifestyle and patterns of consumption, and production. Emissions reductions in CO2 from fossil fuels and industrial processes, due to improvements in energy intensity of GDP and carbon intensity of energy, have been less than emissions increases from rising global activity levels in industry, energy supply, transport, agriculture and buildings. The 10% of households with the highest per capita emissions contribute 34–45% of global consumption-based household GHG emissions, while the middle 40% contribute 40–53%, and the bottom 50% contribute 13–15%. An increasing share of emissions can be attributed to urban areas . The drivers of urban GHG emissions 73 are complex and include population size, income, state of urbanisation and urban form.<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Progress in Adaptation
Text: Adaptation Actions to Date  Progress in adaptation planning and implementation has been observed across all sectors and regions, generating multiple benefits. The ambition, scope and progress on adaptation have risen among governments at the local, national and international levels, along with businesses, communities and civil society . Various tools, measures and processes are available that can enable, accelerate and sustain adaptation implementation . Growing public and political awareness of climate impacts and risks has resulted in at least 170 countries and many cities including adaptation in their climate policies and planning processes . Decision support tools and climate services are increasingly being used and pilot projects and local experiments are being implemented in different sectors .  Adaptation to water-related risks and impacts make up the majority of all documented adaptation. A large number of these adaptation responses are in the agriculture sector and these include on-farm water management, water storage, soil moisture conservation, and irrigation. Other adaptations in agriculture include cultivar improvements, agroforestry, community-based adaptation and farm and landscape diversification among others. For inland flooding, combinations of non-structural measures like early warning systems, enhancing natural water retention such as by restoring wetlands and rivers, and land use planning such as no build zones or upstream forest management, can reduce flood risk . Some land-related adaptation actions such as sustainable food production, improved and sustainable forest management, soil organic carbon management, ecosystem conservation and land restoration, reduced deforestation and degradation, and reduced food loss and waste are being undertaken, and can have mitigation co-benefits. Adaptation actions that increase the resilience of biodiversity and ecosystem services to climate change include responses like minimising additional stresses or disturbances, reducing fragmentation, increasing natural habitat extent, connectivity and heterogeneity, and protecting small-scale refugia where microclimate conditions can allow species to persist. Most innovations in urban adaptation have occurred through advances in disaster risk management, social safety nets and green/blue infrastructure. Many adaptation measures that benefit health and well-being are found in other sectors  .  Adaptation can generate multiple additional benefits such as improving agricultural productivity, innovation, health and well-being, food security, livelihood, and biodiversity conservation as well as reduction of risks and damages.  Globally tracked adaptation finance has shown an upward trend since AR5, but represents only a small portion of total climate finance, is uneven and has developed heterogeneously across regions and sectors. Adaptation finance has come predominantly from public sources, largely through grants, concessional and non-concessional instruments. Globally, private-sector financing of adaptation from a variety of sources such as commercial financial institutions, institutional investors, other private equity, non-financial corporations, as well as communities and households has been limited, especially in developing countries . Public mechanisms and finance can leverage private sector finance for adaptation by addressing real and perceived regulatory, cost and market barriers, for example via public-private partnerships. Innovations in adaptation and resilience finance, such as forecast-based/anticipatory financing systems and regional risk insurance pools, have been piloted and are growing in scale.  There are adaptation options which are effective in reducing climate risks 85 for specific contexts, sectors and regions and contribute positively to sustainable development and other societal goals. In the agriculture sector, cultivar improvements, on-farm water management and storage, soil moisture conservation, irrigation 86, agroforestry, community-based adaptation, and farm and landscape level diversification, and sustainable land management approaches, provide multiple benefits and reduce climate risks. Reduction of food loss and waste, and adaptation measures in support of balanced diets contribute to nutrition, health, and biodiversity benefits.  Ecosystem-based Adaptation 87 approaches such as urban greening, restoration of wetlands and upstream forest ecosystems reduce a range of climate change risks, including flood risks, urban heat and provide multiple co-benefits. Some land-based adaptation options provide immediate benefits ; while afforestation and reforestation, restoration of high-carbon ecosystems, agroforestry, and the reclamation of degraded soils take more time to deliver measurable results. Significant synergies exist between adaptation and mitigation, for example through sustainable land management approaches. Agroecological principles and practices and other approaches that work with natural processes support food security, nutrition, health and well-being, livelihoods and biodiversity, sustainability and ecosystem services.  Combinations of non-structural measures like early warning systems and structural measures like levees have reduced loss of lives in case of inland flooding and early warning systems along with flood-proofing of buildings have proven to be cost-effective in the context of coastal flooding under current sea level rise . Heat Health Action Plans that include early warning and response systems are effective adaptation options for extreme heat . Effective adaptation options for water, food and vector-borne diseases include improving access to potable water, reducing exposure of water and sanitation systems to extreme weather events, and improved early warning systems, surveillance, and vaccine development. Adaptation options such as disaster risk management, early warning systems, climate services and social safety nets have broad applicability across multiple sectors .  Integrated, multi-sectoral solutions that address social inequities, differentiate responses based on climate risk and cut across systems, increase the feasibility and effectiveness of adaptation in multiple sectors.<end_of_turn>

In the agriculture sector, cultivar improvements, on-farm water management and storage, soil moisture conservation, irrigation 86, agroforestry, community-based adaptation, and farm and landscape level diversification, and sustainable land management approaches, provide multiple benefits and reduce climate risks. Reduction of food loss and waste, and adaptation measures in support of balanced diets contribute to nutrition, health, and biodiversity benefits.  Ecosystem-based Adaptation 87 approaches such as urban greening, restoration of wetlands and upstream forest ecosystems reduce a range of climate change risks, including flood risks, urban heat and provide multiple co-benefits. Some land-based adaptation options provide immediate benefits ; while afforestation and reforestation, restoration of high-carbon ecosystems, agroforestry, and the reclamation of degraded soils take more time to deliver measurable results. Significant synergies exist between adaptation and mitigation, for example through sustainable land management approaches. Agroecological principles and practices and other approaches that work with natural processes support food security, nutrition, health and well-being, livelihoods and biodiversity, sustainability and ecosystem services.  Combinations of non-structural measures like early warning systems and structural measures like levees have reduced loss of lives in case of inland flooding and early warning systems along with flood-proofing of buildings have proven to be cost-effective in the context of coastal flooding under current sea level rise . Heat Health Action Plans that include early warning and response systems are effective adaptation options for extreme heat . Effective adaptation options for water, food and vector-borne diseases include improving access to potable water, reducing exposure of water and sanitation systems to extreme weather events, and improved early warning systems, surveillance, and vaccine development. Adaptation options such as disaster risk management, early warning systems, climate services and social safety nets have broad applicability across multiple sectors .  Integrated, multi-sectoral solutions that address social inequities, differentiate responses based on climate risk and cut across systems, increase the feasibility and effectiveness of adaptation in multiple sectors.<end_of_turn>

There is increased evidence of maladaptation in various sectors and regions. Examples of maladaptation are observed in urban areas , agriculture , ecosystems (e.g. fire suppression in naturally Lack of Finance as a Barrier to Climate Action  Insufficient financing, and a lack of political frameworks and incentives for finance, are key causes of the implementation gaps for both mitigation and adaptation. Financial flows remained heavily focused on mitigation, are uneven, and have developed heterogeneously across regions and sectors. In 2018, public and publicly mobilised private climate finance flows from developed to developing countries were below the collective goal under the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement to mobilise USD 100 billion per year by 2020 in the context of meaningful mitigation action and transparency on implementation . Public and private finance flows for fossil fuels are still greater than those for climate adaptation and mitigation . The overwhelming majority of tracked climate finance is directed towards mitigation. Nevertheless, average annual modelled investment requirements for 2020 to 2030 in scenarios that limit warming to 2°C or 1.5°C are a factor of three to six greater than current levels, and total mitigation investments would need to increase across all sectors and regions. Challenges remain for green bonds and similar products, in particular around integrity and additionality, as well as the limited applicability of these markets to many developing countries.  Current global financial flows for adaptation including from public and private finance sources, are insufficient for and constrain implementation of adaptation options, especially in developing countries. There are widening disparities between the estimated costs of adaptation and the documented finance allocated to adaptation. Adaptation finance needs are estimated to be higher than those assessed in AR5, and the enhanced mobilisation of and access to financial resources are essential for implementation of adaptation and to reduce adaptation gaps. Annual finance flows targeting adaptation for Africa, for example, are billions of USD less than the lowest adaptation cost estimates for near-term climate change. Adverse climate impacts can further reduce the availability of financial resources by causing losses and damages and impeding national economic growth, thereby further increasing financial constraints for adaptation particularly for developing countries and LDCs.  Without effective mitigation and adaptation, losses and damages will continue to disproportionately affect the poorest and most vulnerable populations. Accelerated financial support for developing countries from developed countries and other sources is a critical enabler to enhance mitigation action . Many developing countries lack comprehensive data at the scale needed and lack adequate financial resources needed for adaptation for reducing associated economic and non-economic losses and damages.  There are barriers to redirecting capital towards climate action both within and outside the global financial sector. These barriers include: the inadequate assessment of climate-related risks and investment opportunities, regional mismatch between available capital and investment needs, home bias factors, country indebtedness levels, economic vulnerability, and limited institutional capacities. Challenges from outside the financial sector include: limited local capital markets; unattractive risk-return profiles, in particular due to missing or weak regulatory environments that are inconsistent with ambition levels; limited institutional capacity to ensure safeguards; standardisation, aggregation, scalability and replicability of investment opportunities and financing models; and, a pipeline ready for commercial investments.<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Mitigation Options
Text: Mitigation Actions to Date  There has been a consistent expansion of policies and laws addressing mitigation since AR5. Climate governance supports mitigation by providing frameworks through which diverse actors interact, and a basis for policy development and implementation. Many regulatory and economic instruments have already been deployed successfully. By 2020, laws primarily focussed on reducing GHG emissions existed in 56 countries covering 53% of global emissions. The application of diverse policy instruments for mitigation at the national and sub-national levels has grown consistently across a range of sectors. Policy coverage is uneven across sectors and remains limited for emissions from agriculture, and from industrial materials and feedstocks.  Practical experience has informed economic instrument design and helped to improve predictability, environmental effectiveness, economic efficiency, alignment with distributional goals, and social acceptance. Low-emission technological innovation is strengthened through the combination of technology-push policies, together with policies that create incentives for behaviour change and market opportunities. Comprehensive and consistent policy packages have been found to be more effective than single policies. Combining mitigation with policies to shift development pathways, policies that induce lifestyle or behaviour changes, for example, measures promoting walkable urban areas combined with electrification and renewable energy can create health co-benefits from cleaner air and enhanced active mobility . Climate governance enables mitigation by providing an overall direction, setting targets, mainstreaming climate action across policy domains and levels, based on national circumstances and in the context of international cooperation. Effective governance enhances regulatory certainty, creating specialised organisations and creating the context to mobilise finance. These functions can be promoted by climate-relevant laws, which are growing in number, or climate strategies, among others, based on national and sub-national context. Effective and equitable climate governance builds on engagement with civil society actors, political actors, businesses, youth, labour, media, Indigenous Peoples and local communities.  The unit costs of several low-emission technologies, including solar, wind and lithium-ion batteries, have fallen consistently since 2010. Design and process innovations in combination with the use of digital technologies have led to near-commercial availability of many low or zero emissions options in buildings, transport and industry. From 2010-2019, there have been sustained decreases in the unit costs of solar energy , wind energy, and lithium-ion batteries, and large increases in their deployment, e.g., >10× for solar and >100× for electric vehicles, albeit varying widely across regions. Electricity from PV and wind is now cheaper than electricity from fossil sources in many regions, electric vehicles are increasingly competitive with internal combustion engines, and large-scale battery storage on electricity grids is increasingly viable. In comparison to modular small-unit size technologies, the empirical record shows that multiple large-scale mitigation technologies, with fewer opportunities for learning, have seen minimal cost reductions and their adoption has grown slowly. Maintaining emission-intensive systems may, in some regions and sectors, be more expensive than transitioning to low emission systems.  For almost all basic materials – primary metals, building materials and chemicals – many low- to zero-GHG intensity production processes are at the pilot to near-commercial and in some cases commercial stage but they are not yet established industrial practice. Integrated design in construction and retrofit of buildings has led to increasing examples of zero energy or zero carbon buildings. Technological innovation made possible the widespread adoption of LED lighting. Digital technologies including sensors, the internet of things, robotics, and artificial intelligence can improve energy management in all sectors; they can increase energy efficiency, and promote the adoption of many low-emission technologies, including decentralised renewable energy, while creating economic opportunities. However, some of these climate change mitigation gains can be reduced or counterbalanced by growth in demand for goods and services due to the use of digital devices. Several mitigation options, notably solar energy, wind energy, electrification of urban systems, urban green infrastructure, energy efficiency, demand side management, improved forest- and crop/grassland management, and reduced food waste and loss, are technically viable, are becoming increasingly cost effective and are generally supported by the public, and this enables expanded deployment in many regions.  The magnitude of global climate finance flows has increased and financing channels have broadened. Annual tracked total financial flows for climate mitigation and adaptation increased by up to 60% between 2013/14 and 2019/20, but average growth has slowed since 2018 and most climate finance stays within national borders. Markets for green bonds, environmental, social and governance and sustainable finance products have expanded significantly since AR5 . Investors, central banks, and financial regulators are driving increased awareness of climate risk to support climate policy development and implementation. Accelerated international financial cooperation is a critical enabler of low-GHG and just transitions.  Economic instruments have been effective in reducing emissions, complemented by regulatory instruments mainly at the national and also sub-national and regional level. By 2020, over 20% of global GHG emissions were covered by carbon taxes or emissions trading systems, although coverage and prices have been insufficient to achieve deep reductions. Equity and distributional impacts of carbon pricing instruments can be addressed by using revenue from carbon taxes or emissions trading to support low-income households, among other approaches. The mix of policy instruments which reduced costs and stimulated adoption of solar energy, wind energy and lithium-ion batteries includes public R&D, funding for demonstration and pilot projects, and demand-pull instruments such as deployment subsidies to attain scale .  Mitigation actions, supported by policies, have contributed to a decrease in global energy and carbon intensity between 2010 and 2019, with a growing number of countries achieving absolute GHG emission reductions for more than a decade . While global net GHG emissions have increased since 2010, global energy intensity decreased by 2% yr –1 between 2010 and 2019. Global carbon intensity also decreased by 0.3% yr –1 , mainly due to fuel switching from coal to gas, reduced expansion of coal capacity, and increased use of renewables, and with large regional variations over the same period. In many countries, policies have enhanced energy efficiency, reduced rates of deforestation and accelerated technology deployment, leading to avoided and in some cases reduced or removed emissions. At least 18 countries have sustained production-based CO2 and GHG and consumption-based CO2 absolute emission reductions for longer than 10 years since 2005 through energy supply decarbonization, energy efficiency gains, and energy demand reduction, which resulted from both policies and changes in economic structure. Some countries have reduced production-based GHG emissions by a third or more since peaking, and some have achieved reduction rates of around 4% yr–1 for several years consecutively. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that mitigation policies have led to avoided global emissions of several GtCO 2-eq yr–1. At least 1.8 GtCO2-eq yr–1 of avoided emissions can be accounted for by aggregating separate estimates for the effects of economic and regulatory instruments. Growing numbers of laws and executive orders have impacted global emissions and are estimated to have resulted in 5.9 GtCO2 -eq yr–1 of avoided emissions in 2016. These reductions have only partly offset global emissions growth.<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Emission Gap
Text: The Gap Between Mitigation Policies, Pledges and  Pathways that Limit Warming to 1.5°C or Below 2°C Global GHG emissions in 2030 associated with the implementation of NDCs announced prior to COP2691 would make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5°C during the 21st century and would make it harder to limit warming below 2°C – if no additional commitments are made or actions taken. A substantial ‘emissions gap’ exists as global GHG emissions in 2030 associated with the implementation of NDCs announced prior to COP26 would be similar to or only slightly below 2019 emission levels and higher than those associated with modelled mitigation pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot or to 2°C, assuming immediate action, which implies deep, rapid, and sustained global GHG emission reductions this decade  . 92 The magnitude of the emissions gap depends on the global warming level considered and whether only unconditional or also conditional elements of NDCs 93 are considered . Modelled pathways that are consistent with NDCs announced prior to COP26 until 2030 and assume no increase in ambition thereafter have higher emissions, leading to a median global warming of 2.8 [2.1 to 3.4]°C by 2100 . If the ‘emission gap’ is not reduced, global GHG emissions in 2030 consistent with NDCs announced prior to COP26 make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5°C during the 21st century, while limiting warming to 2°C would imply an unprecedented acceleration of mitigation efforts during 2030–2050 .  Policies implemented by the end of 2020 are projected to result in higher global GHG emissions in 2030 than those implied by NDCs, indicating an ‘implementation gap 94 ’ . Projected global emissions implied by policies implemented by the end of 2020 are 57 GtCO2 -eq in 2030. This points to an implementation gap compared with the NDCs of 4 to 7 GtCO 2-eq in 2030; without a strengthening of policies, emissions are projected to rise, leading to a median global warming of 2.2°C to 3.5°C by 2100 .  Projected cumulative future CO2 emissions over the lifetime of existing fossil fuel infrastructure without additional abatement exceed the total cumulative net CO2 emissions in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot. They are approximately equal to total cumulative net CO2 emissions in pathways that limit warming to 2°C with a likelihood of 83% 96. Limiting warming to 2°C or lower will result in stranded assets. About 80% of coal, 50% of gas, and 30% of oil reserves cannot be burned and emitted if warming is limited to 2°C. Significantly more reserves are expected to remain unburned if warming is limited to 1.5°C.  Many countries have signalled an intention to achieve net zero GHG or net zero CO 2 emissions by around mid-century . More than 100 countries have either adopted, announced or are discussing net zero GHG or net zero CO 2 emissions commitments, covering more than two-thirds of global GHG emissions. A growing number of cities are setting climate targets, including net zero GHG targets. Many companies and institutions have also announced net zero emissions targets in recent years. The various net zero emission pledges differ across countries in terms of scope and specificity, and limited policies are to date in place to deliver on them.  All mitigation strategies face implementation challenges, including technology risks, scaling, and costs. Almost all mitigation options also face institutional barriers that need to be addressed to enable their application at scale . Current development pathways may create behavioural, spatial, economic and social barriers to accelerated mitigation at all scales. Choices made by policymakers, citizens, the private sector and other stakeholders influence societies’ development pathways. Structural factors of national circumstances and capabilities  affect the breadth and depth of climate governance. The extent to which civil society actors, political actors, businesses, youth, labour, media, Indigenous Peoples, and local communities are engaged influences political support for climate change mitigation and eventual policy outcomes.  The adoption of low-emission technologies lags in most developing countries, particularly least developed ones, due in part to weaker enabling conditions, including limited finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity . In many countries, especially those with limited institutional capacity, several adverse side-effects have been observed as a result of diffusion of low-emission technology, e.g., low-value employment, and dependency on foreign knowledge and suppliers. Low-emission innovation along with strengthened enabling conditions can reinforce development benefits, which can, in turn, create feedbacks towards greater public support for policy. Persistent and region-specific barriers also continue to hamper the economic and political feasibility of deploying AFOLU mitigation options. Barriers to implementation of AFOLU mitigation include insufficient institutional and financial support, uncertainty over long-term additionality and trade-offs, weak governance, insecure land ownership, low incomes and the lack of access to alternative sources of income, and the risk of reversal . The Timing and Urgency of Climate Action  The magnitude and rate of climate change and associated risks depend strongly on near-term mitigation and adaptation actions . Global warming is more likely than not to reach 1.5°C between 2021 and 2040 even under the very low GHG emission scenarios, and likely or very likely to exceed 1.5°C under higher emissions scenarios 141. Many adaptation options have medium or high feasibility up to 1.5°C , but hard limits to adaptation have already been reached in some ecosystems and the effectiveness of adaptation to reduce climate risk will decrease with increasing warming. Societal choices and actions implemented in this decade determine the extent to which medium- and long-term pathways will deliver higher or lower climate resilient development. Climate resilient development prospects are increasingly limited if current greenhouse gas emissions do not rapidly decline, especially if 1.5°C global warming is exceeded in the near term. Without urgent, effective and equitable adaptation and mitigation actions, climate change increasingly threatens the health and livelihoods of people around the globe, ecosystem health, and biodiversity, with severe adverse consequences for current and future generations. .  In modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot and in those that limit warming to 2°C, assuming immediate actions, global GHG emissions are projected to peak in the early 2020s followed by rapid and deep GHG emissions reductions 142 . In pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, net global GHG emissions are projected to fall by 43 [34 to 60]%143 below 2019 levels by 2030, 60 [49 to 77]% by 2035, 69 [58 to 90]% by 2040 and 84 [73 to 98]% by 2050 144. Global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C have reductions in GHG emissions below 2019 levels of 21 [1 to 42]% by 2030, 35 [22 to 55] % by 2035, 46 [34 to 63] % by 2040 and 64 [53 to 77]% by 2050145. Global GHG emissions associated with NDCs announced prior to COP26 would make it likely that warming would exceed 1.5°C and limiting warming to 2°C would then imply a rapid acceleration of emission reductions during 2030–2050, around 70% faster than in pathways where immediate action is taken to limit warming to 2°C Continued investments in unabated high-emitting infrastructure and limited development and deployment of low-emitting alternatives prior to 2030 would act as barriers to this acceleration and increase feasibility risks.  All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 involve reductions in both net CO 2 emissions and non-CO 2 emissions. For example, in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, global CH4 emissions are reduced by 34 [21 to 57]% below 2019 levels by 2030 and by 44 [31 to 63]% in 2040. Global CH 4 emissions are reduced by 24 [9 to 53]% below 2019 levels by 2030 and by 37 [20 to 60]% in 2040 in modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C with action starting in 2020.  All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 involve GHG emission reductions in all sectors . The contributions of different sectors vary across modelled mitigation pathways. In most global modelled mitigation pathways, emissions from land-use, land-use change and forestry, via reforestation and reduced deforestation, and from the energy supply sector reach net zero CO2 emissions earlier than the buildings, industry and transport sectors. Strategies can rely on combinations of different options, but doing less in one sector needs to be compensated by further reductions in other sectors if warming is to be limited.  Without rapid, deep and sustained mitigation and accelerated adaptation actions, losses and damages will continue to increase, including projected adverse impacts in Africa, LDCs, SIDS, Central and South America , Asia and the Arctic, and will disproportionately affect the most vulnerable populations .<end_of_turn>

* A substantial ‘emissions gap’ exists as global GHG emissions in 2030 associated with the implementation of NDCs announced prior to COP26 would be similar to or only slightly below 2019 emission levels and higher than those associated with modelled mitigation pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot or to 2°C.


* The magnitude of the emissions gap depends on the global warming level considered and whether only unconditional or also conditional elements of NDCs are considered.


* Policies implemented by the end of 2020 are projected to result in higher global GHG emissions in 2030 than those implied by NDCs, indicating an ‘implementation gap’.


* Projected global emissions implied by policies implemented by the end of 2020 are 57 GtCO2 -eq in 2030.


* Limiting warming to 2°C or lower will result in stranded assets.


* Many countries have signaled an intention to achieve net zero GHG or net zero CO 2 emissions by around mid-century.


* The adoption of low-emission technologies lags in most developing countries, particularly least developed ones, due in part to weaker enabling conditions.


* The extent to which civil society actors, political actors, businesses, youth, labour, media, Indigenous Peoples, and local communities are engaged influences political support for climate change mitigation and eventual policy outcomes.<eos>","0.7917673921164048","0.9095738471079093","0.9240042067783396","0.7338898542134562","0.8398088250540274","16.706123113632202"

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Natural Variability
Text: Near-Term Risks  Many changes in the climate system, including extreme events, will become larger in the near term with increasing global warming. Multiple climatic and non-climatic risks will interact, resulting in increased compounding and cascading impacts becoming more difficult to manage. Losses and damages will increase with increasing global warming, while strongly concentrated among the poorest vulnerable populations. Continuing with current unsustainable development patterns would increase exposure and vulnerability of ecosystems and people to climate hazards. Global warming will continue to increase in the near term mainly due to increased cumulative CO 2 emissions in nearly all considered scenarios and pathways. In the near term, every region in the world is projected to face further increases in climate hazards , increasing multiple risks to ecosystems and humans. In the near term, natural variability will modulate human-caused changes, either attenuating or amplifying projected changes, especially at regional scales, with little effect on centennial global warming. Those modulations are important to consider in adaptation planning. Global surface temperature in any single year can vary above or below the long-term human-induced trend, due to natural variability. By 2030, global surface temperature in any individual year could exceed 1.5°C relative to 1850–1900 with a probability between 40% and 60%, across the five scenarios assessed in WGI. The occurrence of individual years with global surface temperature change above a certain level does not imply that this global warming level has been reached. If a large explosive volcanic eruption were to occur in the near term 150, it would temporarily and partially mask human-caused climate change by reducing global surface temperature and precipitation, especially over land, for one to three years.  The level of risk for humans and ecosystems will depend on near-term trends in vulnerability, exposure, level of socio-economic development and adaptation. In the near term, many climate-associated risks to natural and human systems depend more strongly on changes in these systems’ vulnerability and exposure than on differences in climate hazards between emissions scenarios . Future exposure to climatic hazards is increasing globally due to socio-economic development trends including growing inequality, and when urbanisation or migration increase exposure . Urbanisation increases hot extremes  and precipitation runoff intensity. Increasing urbanisation in low-lying and coastal zones will be a major driver of increasing exposure to extreme riverflow events and sea level rise hazards, increasing risks. Vulnerability will also rise rapidly in low-lying Small Island Developing States and atolls in the context of sea level rise . Human vulnerability will concentrate in informal settlements and rapidly growing smaller settlements; and vulnerability in rural areas will be heightened by reduced habitability and high reliance on climate-sensitive livelihoods. Human and ecosystem vulnerability are interdependent. Vulnerability to climate change for ecosystems will be strongly influenced by past, present, and future patterns of human development, including from unsustainable consumption and production, increasing demographic pressures, and persistent unsustainable use and management of land, ocean, and water. Several near-term risks can be moderated with adaptation.  Principal hazards and associated risks expected in the near term are: • Increased intensity and frequency of hot extremes and dangerous heat-humidity conditions, with increased human mortality, morbidity, and labour productivity loss.  • Increasing frequency of marine heatwaves will increase risks of biodiversity loss in the oceans, including from mass mortality events.  • Near-term risks for biodiversity loss are moderate to high in forest ecosystems and kelp and seagrass ecosystems and are high to very high in Arctic sea-ice and terrestrial ecosystems and warm-water coral reefs.  • More intense and frequent extreme rainfall and associated flooding in many regions including coastal and other low-lying cities , and increased proportion of and peak wind speeds of intense tropical cyclones.  • High risks from dryland water scarcity, wildfire damage, and permafrost degradation.  • Continued sea level rise and increased frequency and magnitude of extreme sea level events encroaching on coastal human settlements and damaging coastal infrastructure , committing low-lying coastal ecosystems to submergence and loss, expanding land salinization, with cascading to risks to livelihoods, health, well-being, cultural values, food and water security.  • Climate change will significantly increase ill health and premature deaths from the near to long term. Further warming will increase climate-sensitive food-borne, water-borne, and vector-borne disease risks, and mental health challenges including anxiety and stress.  Cryosphere-related changes in floods, landslides, and water availability have the potential to lead to severe consequences for people, infrastructure and the economy in most mountain regions .  • The projected increase in frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation will increase rain-generated local flooding.  Multiple climate change risks will increasingly compound and cascade in the near term. Many regions are projected to experience an increase in the probability of compound events with higher global warming including concurrent heatwaves and drought. Risks to health and food production will be made more severe from the interaction of sudden food production losses from heat and drought, exacerbated by heatinduced labour productivity losses. These interacting impacts will increase food prices, reduce household incomes, and lead to health risks of malnutrition and climate-related mortality with no or low levels of adaptation, especially in tropical regions . Concurrent and cascading risks from climate change to food systems, human settlements, infrastructure and health will make these risks more severe and more difficult to manage, including when interacting with non-climatic risk drivers such as competition for land between urban expansion and food production, and pandemics . Loss of ecosystems and their services has cascading and long-term impacts on people globally, especially for Indigenous Peoples and local communities who are directly dependent on ecosystems, to meet basic needs. Increasing transboundary risks are projected across the food, energy and water sectors as impacts from weather and climate extremes propagate through supply-chains, markets, and natural resource flows and may interact with impacts from other crises such as pandemics. Risks also arise from some responses intended to reduce the risks of climate change, including risks from maladaptation and adverse side effects of some emissions reduction and carbon dioxide removal measures, such as afforestation of naturally unforested land or poorly implemented bioenergy compounding climate-related risks to biodiversity, food and water security, and livelihoods.  With every increment of global warming losses and damages will increase, become increasingly difficult to avoid and be strongly concentrated among the poorest vulnerable populations. Adaptation does not prevent all losses and damages, even with effective adaptation and before reaching soft and hard limits. Losses and damages will be unequally distributed across systems, regions and sectors and are not comprehensively addressed by current financial, governance and institutional arrangements, particularly in vulnerable developing countries. .<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Unavoidable Changes
Text: The Likelihood and Risks of Abrupt and Irreversible  Change The likelihood of abrupt and irreversible changes and their impacts increase with higher global warming levels. As warming levels increase, so do the risks of species extinction or irreversible loss of biodiversity in ecosystems such as forests , coral reefs and in Arctic regions . Risks associated with large-scale singular events or tipping points, such as ice sheet instability or ecosystem loss from tropical forests, transition to high risk between 1.5°C to 2.5°C  and to very high risk between 2.5°C to 4°C. The response of biogeochemical cycles to anthropogenic perturbations can be abrupt at regional scales and irreversible on decadal to century time scales. The probability of crossing uncertain regional thresholds increases with further warming.  Sea level rise is unavoidable for centuries to millennia due to continuing deep ocean warming and ice sheet melt, and sea levels will remain elevated for thousands of years . Global mean sea level rise will continue in the 21st century, with projected regional relative sea level rise within 20% of the global mean along two-thirds of the global coastline . The magnitude, the rate, the timing of threshold exceedances, and the long-term commitment of sea level rise depend on emissions, with higher emissions leading to greater and faster rates of sea level rise. Due to relative sea level rise, extreme sea level events that occurred once per century in the recent past are projected to occur at least annually at more than half of all tide gauge locations by 2100 and risks for coastal ecosystems, people and infrastructure will continue to increase beyond 2100. At sustained warming levels between 2°C and 3°C, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will be lost almost completely and irreversibly over multiple millennia. The probability and rate of ice mass loss increase with higher global surface temperatures. Over the next 2000 years, global mean sea level will rise by about 2 to 3 m if warming is limited to 1.5°C and 2 to 6 m if limited to 2°C . Projections of multi-millennial global mean sea level rise are consistent with reconstructed levels during past warm climate periods: global mean sea level was very likely 5 to 25 m higher than today roughly 3 million years ago, when global temperatures were 2.5°C to 4°C higher than 1850–1900. Further examples of unavoidable changes in the climate system due to multi-decadal or longer response timescales include continued glacier melt  and permafrost carbon loss.  The probability of low-likelihood outcomes associated with potentially very large impacts increases with higher global warming levels. Warming substantially above the assessed very likely range for a given scenario cannot be ruled out, and there is high confidence this would lead to regional changes greater than assessed in many aspects of the climate system. Low-likelihood, high-impact outcomes could occur at regional scales even for global warming within the very likely assessed range for a given GHG emissions scenario. Global mean sea level rise above the likely range – approaching 2 m by 2100 and in excess of 15 m by 2300 under a very high GHG emissions scenario  – cannot be ruled out due to deep uncertainty in ice-sheet processes 123 and would have severe impacts on populations in low elevation coastal zones. If global warming increases, some compound extreme events 124 will become more frequent, with higher likelihood of unprecedented intensities, durations or spatial extent. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is very likely to weaken over the 21st century for all considered scenarios, however an abrupt collapse is not expected before 2100 . If such a low probability event were to occur, it would very likely cause abrupt shifts in regional weather patterns and water cycle, such as a southward shift in the tropical rain belt, and large impacts on ecosystems and human activities. A sequence of large explosive volcanic eruptions within decades, as have occurred in the past, is a low-likelihood high-impact event that would lead to substantial cooling globally and regional climate perturbations over several decades.<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Maladaptation
Text: Adaptation Gaps and Barriers  Despite progress, adaptation gaps exist between current levels of adaptation and levels needed to respond to impacts and reduce climate risks. While progress in adaptation implementation is observed across all sectors and regions , many adaptation initiatives prioritise immediate and near-term climate risk reduction, e.g., through hard flood protection, which reduces the opportunity for transformational adaptation . Most observed adaptation is fragmented, small in scale, incremental, sector-specific, and focused more on planning rather than implementation. Further, observed adaptation is unequally distributed across regions and the largest adaptation gaps exist among lower population income groups. In the urban context, the largest adaptation gaps exist in projects that manage complex risks, for example in the food–energy–water–health nexus or the inter-relationships of air quality and climate risk. Many funding, knowledge and practice gaps remain for effective implementation, monitoring and evaluation and current adaptation efforts are not expected to meet existing goals. At current rates of adaptation planning and implementation the adaptation gap will continue to grow.  Soft and hard adaptation limits 100 have already been reached in some sectors and regions, in spite of adaptation having buffered some climate impacts. Ecosystems already reaching hard adaptation limits include some warm water coral reefs, some coastal wetlands, some rainforests, and some polar and mountain ecosystems. Individuals and households in low lying coastal areas in Australasia and Small Islands and smallholder farmers in Central and South America, Africa, Europe and Asia have reached soft limits, resulting from financial, governance, institutional and policy constraints and can be overcome by addressing these constraints. Transitioning from incremental to transformational adaptation can help overcome soft adaptation limits .  Adaptation does not prevent all losses and damages, even with effective adaptation and before reaching soft and hard limits. Losses and damages are unequally distributed across systems, regions and sectors and are not comprehensively addressed by current financial, governance and institutional arrangements, particularly in vulnerable developing countries.  There is increased evidence of maladaptation in various sectors and regions. Examples of maladaptation are observed in urban areas , agriculture , ecosystems (e.g. fire suppression in naturally Long-term Adaptation Options and Limits  With increasing warming, adaptation options will become more constrained and less effective. At higher levels of warming, losses and damages will increase, and additional human and natural systems will reach adaptation limits. Integrated, cross-cutting multi-sectoral solutions increase the effectiveness of adaptation. Maladaptation can create lock-ins of vulnerability, exposure and risks but can be avoided by long-term planning and the implementation of adaptation actions that are flexible, multi-sectoral and inclusive. The effectiveness of adaptation to reduce climate risk is documented for specific contexts, sectors and regions and will decrease with increasing warming 125 . For example, common adaptation responses in agriculture – adopting improved cultivars and agronomic practices, and changes in cropping patterns and crop systems – will become less effective from 2°C to higher levels of warming. The effectiveness of most water-related adaptation options to reduce projected risks declines with increasing warming. Adaptations for hydropower and thermo-electric power generation are effective in most regions up to 1.5°C to 2°C, with decreasing effectiveness at higher levels of warming . Ecosystem-based Adaptation is vulnerable to climate change impacts, with effectiveness declining with increasing global warming. Globally, adaptation options related to agroforestry and forestry have a sharp decline in effectiveness at 3°C, with a substantial increase in residual risk.  With increasing global warming, more limits to adaptation will be reached and losses and damages, strongly concentrated among the poorest vulnerable populations, will increase. Already below 1.5°C, autonomous and evolutionary adaptation responses by terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems will increasingly face hard limits. Above 1.5°C, some ecosystem-based adaptation measures will lose their effectiveness in providing benefits to people as these ecosystems will reach hard adaptation limits. Adaptation to address the risks of heat stress, heat mortality and reduced capacities for outdoor work for humans face soft and hard limits across regions that become significantly more severe at 1.5°C, and are particularly relevant for regions with warm climates. Above 1.5°C global warming level, limited freshwater resources pose potential hard limits for small islands and for regions dependent on glacier and snow melt . By 2°C, soft limits are projected for multiple staple crops, particularly in tropical regions. By 3°C, soft limits are projected for some water management measures for many regions, with hard limits projected for parts of Europe .  Integrated, cross-cutting multi-sectoral solutions increase the effectiveness of adaptation. For example, inclusive, integrated and long-term planning at local, municipal, sub-national and national scales, together with effective regulation and monitoring systems and financial and technological resources and capabilities foster urban and rural system transition. There are a range of cross-cutting adaptation options, such as disaster risk management, early warning systems, climate services and risk spreading and sharing that have broad applicability across sectors and provide greater benefits to other adaptation options when combined. Transitioning from incremental to transformational adaptation, and addressing a range of constraints, primarily in the financial, governance, institutional and policy domains, can help overcome soft adaptation limits. However, adaptation does not prevent all losses and damages, even with effective adaptation and before reaching soft and hard limits.  Maladaptive responses to climate change can create lock-ins of vulnerability, exposure and risks that are difficult and expensive to change and exacerbate existing inequalities. Actions that focus on sectors and risks in isolation and on short-term gains often lead to maladaptation. Adaptation options can become maladaptive due to their environmental impacts that constrain ecosystem services and decrease biodiversity and ecosystem resilience to climate change or by causing adverse outcomes for different groups, exacerbating inequity. Maladaptation can be avoided by flexible, multi-sectoral, inclusive and long-term planning and implementation of adaptation actions with benefits to many sectors and systems.  Sea level rise poses a distinctive and severe adaptation challenge as it implies both dealing with slow onset changes and increases in the frequency and magnitude of extreme sea level events . Such adaptation challenges would occur much earlier under high rates of sea level rise. Responses to ongoing sea level rise and land subsidence include protection, accommodation, advance and planned relocation. These responses are more effective if combined and/or sequenced, planned well ahead, aligned with sociocultural values and underpinned by inclusive community engagement processes. Ecosystem-based solutions such as wetlands provide co-benefits for the environment and climate mitigation, and reduce costs for flood defences , but have site-specific physical limits, at least above 1.5ºC of global warming and lose effectiveness at high rates of sea level rise beyond 0.5 to 1 cm yr -1. Seawalls can be maladaptive as they effectively reduce impacts in the short term but can also result in lock-ins and increase exposure to climate risks in the long term unless they are integrated into a long-term adaptive plan.<end_of_turn>

Text: Sure, here's a summary of the main takeaways from the text with respect to the topic:  * The range of future climate change is narrower than in the AR5, with a narrowed range of equilibrium climate sensitivity from 2.5°C to 4.0°C.   * Future warming depends on future GHG emissions, with cumulative net CO2 dominating.   * Deep, rapid, and sustained GHG emissions reductions, reaching net zero CO2 emissions and including strong emissions reductions of other GHGs, are necessary to limit warming to 1.5°C or less than 2°C by the end of century.   * Global warming will continue to increase in the near term in nearly all considered scenarios and modelled pathways.   * Deep, rapid, and sustained reductions in GHG emissions would lead to improvements in air quality within a few years, to reductions in trends of global surface temperature discernible after around 20 years, and over longer time periods for many other climate impact-drivers.   * Continued global warming is projected to further intensify the global water cycle, including its variability, global monsoon precipitation , and very wet and very dry weather and climate events and seasons.   * With every additional increment of global warming, changes in extremes continue to become larger.   * Ocean acidification , ocean deoxygenation and global mean sea level will continue to increase in the 21st century, at rates dependent on future emissions.<eos> Sure, here's a summary of the main takeaways from the text with respect to the topic:  * A finite carbon budget exists, and we cannot exceed it to limit global temperature increase to a specific level. * The best estimates of the remaining carbon budget from the beginning of 2020 for limiting warming to 1.5°C with a 50% likelihood is estimated to be 500 GtCO2; for 2°C this is 1150 GtCO2.128. * Reducing non-CO2 emissions can help lower the resulting temperatures for a given RCB. * Limiting warming to 2°C with a 67% likelihood would imply a RCB of 1150 GtCO2. * The remaining carbon budget is projected to be exhausted if annual CO2 emissions between 2020–2030 stayed at the same level as 2019. * Natural land and ocean carbon sinks are projected to become less effective at slowing the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere as cumulative net CO2 emissions increase.<eos> Sure, here's a summary of the main takeaways from the text with respect to the topic:  * Limiting human-caused global warming to a specific level requires limiting cumulative CO2 emissions to reach net zero or net negative CO2 emissions.   * Achieving global net zero CO2 emissions requires deep and rapid reductions in gross emissions, but the deployment of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is unavoidable.   * The timing of net zero CO2 emissions depends on several variables, including the desired climate outcome, the mitigation strategy, and the gases covered.   * Global net zero CO2 emissions are reached in the early 2050s in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, and around the early 2070s in pathways that limit warming to 2°C.   * Non-CO2 GHG emissions are strongly reduced in all pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower, but residual emissions of CH4 and N2O and F-gases of about 8 GtCO2 -eq yr -1 remain at the time of net zero GHG.<eos> Sure, here's a summary of the main takeaways from the text with respect to the topic:  * Rapid and deep emission reductions in all sectors are crucial for limiting global warming to 2°C or lower by 2100.   * Transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, combined with energy efficiency and conservation measures, can achieve significant reductions in GHG emissions.   * Socio-cultural options and behavioral changes can also contribute to emissions reductions in end-use sectors.   * Achieving net zero CO2 or net GHG emissions through CDR methods can help balance emissions, counterbalance residual emissions, and achieve net negative emissions.   * Land-based mitigation and land-use change are essential components of global mitigation pathways, with various options such as reforestation, afforestation, and bioenergy contributing to emissions reductions.   * CDR methods vary in terms of maturity, removal potential, costs, and governance requirements.   * Afforestation, reforestation, and improved forest management are currently the most widely practiced CDR methods.<eos><end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Effects of Not Limiting CO2
Text: The Gap Between Mitigation Policies, Pledges and  Pathways that Limit Warming to 1.5°C or Below 2°C Global GHG emissions in 2030 associated with the implementation of NDCs announced prior to COP2691 would make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5°C during the 21st century and would make it harder to limit warming below 2°C – if no additional commitments are made or actions taken. A substantial ‘emissions gap’ exists as global GHG emissions in 2030 associated with the implementation of NDCs announced prior to COP26 would be similar to or only slightly below 2019 emission levels and higher than those associated with modelled mitigation pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot or to 2°C, assuming immediate action, which implies deep, rapid, and sustained global GHG emission reductions this decade  . 92 The magnitude of the emissions gap depends on the global warming level considered and whether only unconditional or also conditional elements of NDCs 93 are considered . Modelled pathways that are consistent with NDCs announced prior to COP26 until 2030 and assume no increase in ambition thereafter have higher emissions, leading to a median global warming of 2.8 [2.1 to 3.4]°C by 2100 . If the ‘emission gap’ is not reduced, global GHG emissions in 2030 consistent with NDCs announced prior to COP26 make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5°C during the 21st century, while limiting warming to 2°C would imply an unprecedented acceleration of mitigation efforts during 2030–2050 .  Policies implemented by the end of 2020 are projected to result in higher global GHG emissions in 2030 than those implied by NDCs, indicating an ‘implementation gap 94 ’ . Projected global emissions implied by policies implemented by the end of 2020 are 57 GtCO2 -eq in 2030. This points to an implementation gap compared with the NDCs of 4 to 7 GtCO 2-eq in 2030; without a strengthening of policies, emissions are projected to rise, leading to a median global warming of 2.2°C to 3.5°C by 2100 .  Projected cumulative future CO2 emissions over the lifetime of existing fossil fuel infrastructure without additional abatement exceed the total cumulative net CO2 emissions in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot. They are approximately equal to total cumulative net CO2 emissions in pathways that limit warming to 2°C with a likelihood of 83% 96. Limiting warming to 2°C or lower will result in stranded assets. About 80% of coal, 50% of gas, and 30% of oil reserves cannot be burned and emitted if warming is limited to 2°C. Significantly more reserves are expected to remain unburned if warming is limited to 1.5°C.  Many countries have signalled an intention to achieve net zero GHG or net zero CO 2 emissions by around mid-century . More than 100 countries have either adopted, announced or are discussing net zero GHG or net zero CO 2 emissions commitments, covering more than two-thirds of global GHG emissions. A growing number of cities are setting climate targets, including net zero GHG targets. Many companies and institutions have also announced net zero emissions targets in recent years. The various net zero emission pledges differ across countries in terms of scope and specificity, and limited policies are to date in place to deliver on them.  All mitigation strategies face implementation challenges, including technology risks, scaling, and costs. Almost all mitigation options also face institutional barriers that need to be addressed to enable their application at scale . Current development pathways may create behavioural, spatial, economic and social barriers to accelerated mitigation at all scales. Choices made by policymakers, citizens, the private sector and other stakeholders influence societies’ development pathways. Structural factors of national circumstances and capabilities  affect the breadth and depth of climate governance. The extent to which civil society actors, political actors, businesses, youth, labour, media, Indigenous Peoples, and local communities are engaged influences political support for climate change mitigation and eventual policy outcomes.  The adoption of low-emission technologies lags in most developing countries, particularly least developed ones, due in part to weaker enabling conditions, including limited finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity . In many countries, especially those with limited institutional capacity, several adverse side-effects have been observed as a result of diffusion of low-emission technology, e.g., low-value employment, and dependency on foreign knowledge and suppliers. Low-emission innovation along with strengthened enabling conditions can reinforce development benefits, which can, in turn, create feedbacks towards greater public support for policy. Persistent and region-specific barriers also continue to hamper the economic and political feasibility of deploying AFOLU mitigation options. Barriers to implementation of AFOLU mitigation include insufficient institutional and financial support, uncertainty over long-term additionality and trade-offs, weak governance, insecure land ownership, low incomes and the lack of access to alternative sources of income, and the risk of reversal . Remaining Carbon Budgets  Limiting global temperature increase to a specific level requires limiting cumulative net CO2 emissions to within a finite carbon budget , along with strong reductions in other GHGs. For every 1000 GtCO2 emitted by human activity, global mean temperature rises by likely 0.27°C to 0.63°C. This relationship implies that there is a finite carbon budget that cannot be exceeded in order to limit warming to any given level.  The best estimates of the remaining carbon budget from the beginning of 2020 for limiting warming to 1.5°C with a 50% likelihood is estimated to be 500 GtCO2; for 2°C this is 1150 GtCO2.128 Remaining carbon budgets have been quantified based on the assessed value of TCRE and its uncertainty, estimates of historical warming, climate system feedbacks such as emissions from thawing permafrost, and the global surface temperature change after global anthropogenic CO 2 emissions reach net zero, as well as variations in projected warming from non-CO2 emissions due in part to mitigation action. The stronger the reductions in non-CO2 emissions the lower the resulting temperatures are for a given RCB or the larger RCB for the same level of temperature change. For instance, the RCB for limiting warming to 1.5°C with a 50% likelihood could vary between 300 to 600 GtCO 2 depending on non-CO 2 warming 129 . Limiting warming to 2°C with a 67% likelihood would imply a RCB of 1150 GtCO2 from the beginning of 2020. To stay below 2°C with a 50% likelihood, the RCB is higher, i.e., 1350 GtCO 2 If the annual CO2 emissions between 2020–2030 stayed, on average, at the same level as 2019, the resulting cumulative emissions would almost exhaust the remaining carbon budget for 1.5°C, and exhaust more than a third of the remaining carbon budget for 2°C . Based on central estimates only, historical cumulative net CO2 emissions between 1850 and 2019 amount to about four-fifths of the total carbon budget for a 50% probability of limiting global warming to 1.5°C and to about two-thirds of the total carbon budget for a 67% probability to limit global warming to 2°C.  In scenarios with increasing CO 2 emissions, the land and ocean carbon sinks are projected to be less effective at slowing the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere. While natural land and ocean carbon sinks are projected to take up, in absolute terms, a progressively larger amount of CO 2 under higher compared to lower CO2 emissions scenarios, they become less effective, that is, the proportion of emissions taken up by land and ocean decreases with increasing cumulative net CO2 emissions. Additional ecosystem responses to warming not yet fully included in climate models, such as GHG fluxes from wetlands, permafrost thaw, and wildfires, would further increase concentrations of these gases in the atmosphere . In scenarios where CO2 concentrations peak and decline during the 21st century, the land and ocean begin to take up less carbon in response to declining atmospheric CO2 concentrations  and turn into a weak net source by 2100 in the very low GHG emissions scenario 133.<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Pathways for Limiting Warming
Text: Net Zero Emissions: Timing and Implications  From a physical science perspective, limiting human-caused global warming to a specific level requires limiting cumulative CO2 emissions, reaching net zero or net negative CO2 emissions, along with strong reductions of other GHG emissions . Global modelled pathways that reach and sustain net zero GHG emissions are projected to result in a gradual decline in surface temperature. Reaching net zero GHG emissions primarily requires deep reductions in CO2, methane, and other GHG emissions, and implies net negative CO2 emissions.134 Carbon dioxide removal will be necessary to achieve net negative CO2 emissions 135. Achieving global net zero CO2 emissions, with remaining anthropogenic CO 2 emissions balanced by durably stored CO 2 from anthropogenic removal, is a requirement to stabilise CO2-induced global surface temperature increase . This is different from achieving net zero GHG emissions, where metric-weighted anthropogenic GHG emissions  equal CO 2 removal. Emissions pathways that reach and sustain net zero GHG emissions defined by the 100-year global warming potential imply net negative CO2 emissions and are projected to result in a gradual decline in surface temperature after an earlier peak. While reaching net zero CO2 or net zero GHG emissions requires deep and rapid reductions in gross emissions, the deployment of CDR to counterbalance hardto-abate residual emissions  is unavoidable .  In modelled pathways, the timing of net zero CO2 emissions, followed by net zero GHG emissions, depends on several variables, including the desired climate outcome, the mitigation strategy and the gases covered. Global net zero CO2 emissions are reached in the early 2050s in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, and around the early 2070s in pathways that limit warming to 2°C. While non-CO2 GHG emissions are strongly reduced in all pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower, residual emissions of CH4 and N2O and F-gases of about 8 [5–11] GtCO2 -eq yr -1 remain at the time of net zero GHG, counterbalanced by net negative CO2 emissions. As a result, net zero CO2 would be reached before net zero GHGs . Overshoot Pathways: Increased Risks and Other  Implications Exceeding a specific remaining carbon budget results in higher global warming. Achieving and sustaining net negative global CO 2 emissions could reverse the resulting temperature exceedance. Continued reductions in emissions of short-lived climate forcers, particularly methane, after peak temperature has been reached, would also further reduce warming. Only a small number of the most ambitious global modelled pathways limit global warming to 1.5°C without overshoot.  Overshoot of a warming level results in more adverse impacts, some irreversible, and additional risks for human and natural systems compared to staying below that warming level, with risks growing with the magnitude and duration of overshoot. Compared to pathways without overshoot, societies and ecosystems would be exposed to greater and more widespread changes in climatic impact-drivers, such as extreme heat and extreme precipitation, with increasing risks to infrastructure, low-lying coastal settlements, and associated livelihoods. Overshooting 1.5°C will result in irreversible adverse impacts on certain ecosystems with low resilience, such as polar, mountain, and coastal ecosystems, impacted by ice-sheet melt, glacier melt, or by accelerating and higher committed sea level rise. Overshoot increases the risks of severe impacts, such as increased wildfires, mass mortality of trees, drying of peatlands, thawing of permafrost and weakening natural land carbon sinks; such impacts could increase releases of GHGs making temperature reversal more challenging.  The larger the overshoot, the more net negative CO2 emissions needed to return to a given warming level. Reducing global temperature by removing CO 2 would require net negative emissions of 220 GtCO 2 for every tenth of a degree. Modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot reach median values of cumulative net negative emissions of 220 GtCO2 by 2100, pathways that return warming to 1.5°C after high overshoot reach median values of 360 GtCO2. 137 More rapid reduction in CO 2 and non-CO2 emissions, particularly methane, limits peak warming levels and reduces the requirement for net negative CO2 emissions and CDR, thereby reducing feasibility and sustainability concerns, and social and environmental risks . The Timing and Urgency of Climate Action  The magnitude and rate of climate change and associated risks depend strongly on near-term mitigation and adaptation actions . Global warming is more likely than not to reach 1.5°C between 2021 and 2040 even under the very low GHG emission scenarios, and likely or very likely to exceed 1.5°C under higher emissions scenarios 141. Many adaptation options have medium or high feasibility up to 1.5°C , but hard limits to adaptation have already been reached in some ecosystems and the effectiveness of adaptation to reduce climate risk will decrease with increasing warming. Societal choices and actions implemented in this decade determine the extent to which medium- and long-term pathways will deliver higher or lower climate resilient development. Climate resilient development prospects are increasingly limited if current greenhouse gas emissions do not rapidly decline, especially if 1.5°C global warming is exceeded in the near term. Without urgent, effective and equitable adaptation and mitigation actions, climate change increasingly threatens the health and livelihoods of people around the globe, ecosystem health, and biodiversity, with severe adverse consequences for current and future generations. .  In modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot and in those that limit warming to 2°C, assuming immediate actions, global GHG emissions are projected to peak in the early 2020s followed by rapid and deep GHG emissions reductions 142 . In pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, net global GHG emissions are projected to fall by 43 [34 to 60]%143 below 2019 levels by 2030, 60 [49 to 77]% by 2035, 69 [58 to 90]% by 2040 and 84 [73 to 98]% by 2050 144. Global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C have reductions in GHG emissions below 2019 levels of 21 [1 to 42]% by 2030, 35 [22 to 55] % by 2035, 46 [34 to 63] % by 2040 and 64 [53 to 77]% by 2050145. Global GHG emissions associated with NDCs announced prior to COP26 would make it likely that warming would exceed 1.5°C and limiting warming to 2°C would then imply a rapid acceleration of emission reductions during 2030–2050, around 70% faster than in pathways where immediate action is taken to limit warming to 2°C Continued investments in unabated high-emitting infrastructure and limited development and deployment of low-emitting alternatives prior to 2030 would act as barriers to this acceleration and increase feasibility risks.  All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 involve reductions in both net CO 2 emissions and non-CO 2 emissions. For example, in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, global CH4 emissions are reduced by 34 [21 to 57]% below 2019 levels by 2030 and by 44 [31 to 63]% in 2040. Global CH 4 emissions are reduced by 24 [9 to 53]% below 2019 levels by 2030 and by 37 [20 to 60]% in 2040 in modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C with action starting in 2020.  All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 involve GHG emission reductions in all sectors . The contributions of different sectors vary across modelled mitigation pathways. In most global modelled mitigation pathways, emissions from land-use, land-use change and forestry, via reforestation and reduced deforestation, and from the energy supply sector reach net zero CO2 emissions earlier than the buildings, industry and transport sectors. Strategies can rely on combinations of different options, but doing less in one sector needs to be compensated by further reductions in other sectors if warming is to be limited.  Without rapid, deep and sustained mitigation and accelerated adaptation actions, losses and damages will continue to increase, including projected adverse impacts in Africa, LDCs, SIDS, Central and South America , Asia and the Arctic, and will disproportionately affect the most vulnerable populations .<end_of_turn>

Sectoral Contributions to Mitigation  All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 involve rapid and deep and in most cases immediate GHG emissions reductions in all sectors. Reductions in GHG emissions in industry, transport, buildings, and urban areas can be achieved through a combination of energy efficiency and conservation and a transition to low-GHG technologies and energy carriers. Socio-cultural options and behavioural change can reduce global GHG emissions of end-use sectors, with most of the potential in developed countries, if combined with improved infrastructure design and access.  Global modelled mitigation pathways reaching net zero CO2 and GHG emissions include transitioning from fossil fuels without carbon capture and storage to very low- or zero-carbon energy sources, such as renewables or fossil fuels with CCS, demand-side measures and improving efficiency, reducing non-CO2 GHG emissions, and CDR 136. In global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or below, almost all electricity is supplied from zero or low-carbon sources in 2050, such as renewables or fossil fuels with CO2 capture and storage, combined with increased electrification of energy demand. Such pathways meet energy service demand with relatively low energy use, through e.g., enhanced energy efficiency and behavioural changes and increased electrification of energy end use. Modelled global pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot generally implement such changes faster than pathways limiting global warming to 2°C.  AFOLU mitigation options, when sustainably implemented, can deliver large-scale GHG emission reductions and enhanced CO2 removal; however, barriers to implementation and trade-offs may result from the impacts of climate change, competing demands on land, conflicts with food security and livelihoods, the complexity of land ownership and management systems, and cultural aspects. All assessed modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 include land-based mitigation and land-use change, with most including different combinations of reforestation, afforestation, reduced deforestation, and bioenergy. However, accumulated carbon in vegetation and soils is at risk from future loss triggered by climate change and disturbances such as flood, drought, fire, or pest outbreaks, or future poor management.  In addition to deep, rapid, and sustained emission reductions, CDR can fulfil three complementary roles: lowering net CO2 or net GHG emissions in the near term; counterbalancing ‘hard-to-abate’ residual emissions  to help reach net zero CO2 or GHG emissions, and achieving net negative CO 2 or GHG emissions if deployed at levels exceeding annual residual emissions. CDR methods vary in terms of their maturity, removal process, time scale of carbon storage, storage medium, mitigation potential, cost, co-benefits, impacts and risks, and governance requirements. Specifically, maturity ranges from lower maturity to higher maturity; removal and storage potential ranges from lower potential to higher potential; costs range from lower cost to higher cost  . Estimated storage timescales vary from decades to centuries for methods that store carbon in vegetation and through soil carbon management, to ten thousand years or more for methods that store carbon in geological formations . Afforestation, reforestation, improved forest management, agroforestry and soil carbon sequestration are currently the only widely practiced CDR methods. Methods and levels of CDR deployment in global modelled mitigation pathways vary depending on assumptions about costs, availability and constraints.<end_of_turn>

For example, in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, global CH4 emissions are reduced by 34 [21 to 57]% below 2019 levels by 2030 and by 44 [31 to 63]% in 2040. Global CH 4 emissions are reduced by 24 [9 to 53]% below 2019 levels by 2030 and by 37 [20 to 60]% in 2040 in modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C with action starting in 2020.  All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 involve GHG emission reductions in all sectors . The contributions of different sectors vary across modelled mitigation pathways. In most global modelled mitigation pathways, emissions from land-use, land-use change and forestry, via reforestation and reduced deforestation, and from the energy supply sector reach net zero CO2 emissions earlier than the buildings, industry and transport sectors. Strategies can rely on combinations of different options, but doing less in one sector needs to be compensated by further reductions in other sectors if warming is to be limited.  Without rapid, deep and sustained mitigation and accelerated adaptation actions, losses and damages will continue to increase, including projected adverse impacts in Africa, LDCs, SIDS, Central and South America , Asia and the Arctic, and will disproportionately affect the most vulnerable populations .   Near-Term Mitigation and Adaptation Actions  Rapid and far-reaching transitions across all sectors and systems are necessary to achieve deep and sustained emissions reductions and secure a liveable and sustainable future for all. These system transitions involve a significant upscaling of a wide portfolio of mitigation and adaptation options. Feasible, effective and low-cost options for mitigation and adaptation are already available, with differences across systems and regions.  Rapid and far-reaching transitions across all sectors and systems are necessary to achieve deep emissions reductions and secure a liveable and sustainable future for all. System transitions consistent with pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot are more rapid and pronounced in the near-term than in those that limit warming to 2°C . Such a systemic change is unprecedented in terms of scale, but not necessarily in terms of speed. The system transitions make possible the transformative adaptation required for high levels of human health and well-being, economic and social resilience, ecosystem health, and planetary health.  Feasible, effective and low-cost options for mitigation and adaptation are already available. Mitigation options costing USD 100 tCO 2-eq–1 or less could reduce global GHG emissions by at least half the 2019 level by 2030  . The availability, feasibility 152 and potential of mitigation or effectiveness of adaptation options in the near term differ across systems and regions.  Demand-side measures and new ways of end-use service provision can reduce global GHG emissions in end-use sectors by 40 to 70% by 2050 compared to baseline scenarios, while some regions and socioeconomic groups require additional energy and resources. Demand-side mitigation encompasses changes in infrastructure use, end-use technology adoption, and socio-cultural and behavioural change. .<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Mitigation Synergies
Text: Synergies and trade-offs, costs and benefits  Mitigation and adaptation options can lead to synergies and trade-offs with other aspects of sustainable development . Synergies and trade-offs depend on the pace and magnitude of changes and the development context including inequalities, with consideration of climate justice. The potential or effectiveness of some adaptation and mitigation options decreases as climate change intensifies .  In the energy sector, transitions to low-emission systems will have multiple co-benefits, including improvements in air quality and health. There are potential synergies between sustainable development and, for instance, energy efficiency and renewable energy.  For agriculture, land, and food systems, many land management options and demand-side response options  can contribute to eradicating poverty and eliminating hunger while promoting good health and well-being, clean water and sanitation, and life on land . In contrast, certain adaptation options that promote intensification of production, such as irrigation, may have negative effects on sustainability  .  Reforestation, improved forest management, soil carbon sequestration, peatland restoration and coastal blue carbon management are examples of CDR methods that can enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functions, employment and local livelihoods, depending on context . However, afforestation or production of biomass crops for bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage or biochar can have adverse socio-economic and environmental impacts, including on biodiversity, food and water security, local livelihoods and the rights of Indigenous Peoples, especially if implemented at large scales and where land tenure is insecure.  Modelled pathways that assume using resources more efficiently or shift global development towards sustainability include fewer challenges, such as dependence on CDR and pressure on land and biodiversity, and have the most pronounced synergies with respect to sustainable development .  Strengthening climate change mitigation action entails more rapid transitions and higher up-front investments, but brings benefits from avoiding damages from climate change and reduced adaptation costs. The aggregate effects of climate change mitigation on global GDP  are small compared to global projected GDP growth. Projected estimates of global aggregate net economic damages and the costs of adaptation generally increase with global warming level.  Cost-benefit analysis remains limited in its ability to represent all damages from climate change, including non-monetary damages, or to capture the heterogeneous nature of damages and the risk of catastrophic damages. Even without accounting for these factors or for the co-benefits of mitigation, the global benefits of limiting warming to 2°C exceed the cost of mitigation . This finding is robust against a wide range of assumptions about social preferences on inequalities and discounting over time . Limiting global warming to 1.5°C instead of 2°C would increase the costs of mitigation, but also increase the benefits in terms of reduced impacts and related risks and reduced adaptation needs 140.  Considering other sustainable development dimensions, such as the potentially strong economic benefits on human health from air quality improvement, may enhance the estimated benefits of mitigation . The economic effects of strengthened mitigation action vary across regions and countries, depending notably on economic structure, regional emissions reductions, policy design and level of international cooperation. Ambitious mitigation pathways imply large and sometimes disruptive changes in economic structure, with implications for near-term actions, equity , sustainability, and finance .<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Likelihood of Overshoot
Text: Net Zero Emissions: Timing and Implications  From a physical science perspective, limiting human-caused global warming to a specific level requires limiting cumulative CO2 emissions, reaching net zero or net negative CO2 emissions, along with strong reductions of other GHG emissions . Global modelled pathways that reach and sustain net zero GHG emissions are projected to result in a gradual decline in surface temperature. Reaching net zero GHG emissions primarily requires deep reductions in CO2, methane, and other GHG emissions, and implies net negative CO2 emissions.134 Carbon dioxide removal will be necessary to achieve net negative CO2 emissions 135. Achieving global net zero CO2 emissions, with remaining anthropogenic CO 2 emissions balanced by durably stored CO 2 from anthropogenic removal, is a requirement to stabilise CO2-induced global surface temperature increase . This is different from achieving net zero GHG emissions, where metric-weighted anthropogenic GHG emissions  equal CO 2 removal. Emissions pathways that reach and sustain net zero GHG emissions defined by the 100-year global warming potential imply net negative CO2 emissions and are projected to result in a gradual decline in surface temperature after an earlier peak. While reaching net zero CO2 or net zero GHG emissions requires deep and rapid reductions in gross emissions, the deployment of CDR to counterbalance hardto-abate residual emissions  is unavoidable .  In modelled pathways, the timing of net zero CO2 emissions, followed by net zero GHG emissions, depends on several variables, including the desired climate outcome, the mitigation strategy and the gases covered. Global net zero CO2 emissions are reached in the early 2050s in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, and around the early 2070s in pathways that limit warming to 2°C. While non-CO2 GHG emissions are strongly reduced in all pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower, residual emissions of CH4 and N2O and F-gases of about 8 [5–11] GtCO2 -eq yr -1 remain at the time of net zero GHG, counterbalanced by net negative CO2 emissions. As a result, net zero CO2 would be reached before net zero GHGs . Overshoot Pathways: Increased Risks and Other  Implications Exceeding a specific remaining carbon budget results in higher global warming. Achieving and sustaining net negative global CO 2 emissions could reverse the resulting temperature exceedance. Continued reductions in emissions of short-lived climate forcers, particularly methane, after peak temperature has been reached, would also further reduce warming. Only a small number of the most ambitious global modelled pathways limit global warming to 1.5°C without overshoot.  Overshoot of a warming level results in more adverse impacts, some irreversible, and additional risks for human and natural systems compared to staying below that warming level, with risks growing with the magnitude and duration of overshoot. Compared to pathways without overshoot, societies and ecosystems would be exposed to greater and more widespread changes in climatic impact-drivers, such as extreme heat and extreme precipitation, with increasing risks to infrastructure, low-lying coastal settlements, and associated livelihoods. Overshooting 1.5°C will result in irreversible adverse impacts on certain ecosystems with low resilience, such as polar, mountain, and coastal ecosystems, impacted by ice-sheet melt, glacier melt, or by accelerating and higher committed sea level rise. Overshoot increases the risks of severe impacts, such as increased wildfires, mass mortality of trees, drying of peatlands, thawing of permafrost and weakening natural land carbon sinks; such impacts could increase releases of GHGs making temperature reversal more challenging.  The larger the overshoot, the more net negative CO2 emissions needed to return to a given warming level. Reducing global temperature by removing CO 2 would require net negative emissions of 220 GtCO 2 for every tenth of a degree. Modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot reach median values of cumulative net negative emissions of 220 GtCO2 by 2100, pathways that return warming to 1.5°C after high overshoot reach median values of 360 GtCO2. 137 More rapid reduction in CO 2 and non-CO2 emissions, particularly methane, limits peak warming levels and reduces the requirement for net negative CO2 emissions and CDR, thereby reducing feasibility and sustainability concerns, and social and environmental risks .<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Degree of Overshoot
Text: Impacts and Related Risks  For a given level of warming, many climate-related risks are assessed to be higher than in AR5. Levels of risk for all Reasons for Concern 121 are assessed to become high to very high at lower global warming levels compared to what was assessed in AR5. This is based upon recent evidence of observed impacts, improved process understanding, and new knowledge on exposure and vulnerability of human and natural systems, including limits to adaptation. Depending on the level of global warming, the assessed long-term impacts will be up to multiple times higher than currently observed for 127 identified key risks, e.g., in terms of the number of affected people and species. Risks, including cascading risks and risks from overshoot, are projected to become increasingly severe with every increment of global warming.  Climate-related risks for natural and human systems are higher for global warming of 1.5°C than at present but lower than at 2°C . Climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth are projected to increase with global warming of 1.5°C. In terrestrial ecosystems, 3 to 14% of the tens of thousands of species assessed will likely face a very high risk of extinction at a GWL of 1.5°C. Coral reefs are projected to decline by a further 70–90% at 1.5°C of global warming. At this GWL, many low-elevation and small glaciers around the world would lose most of their mass or disappear within decades to centuries. Regions at disproportionately higher risk include Arctic ecosystems, dryland regions, small island developing states and Least Developed Countries .  At 2°C of global warming, overall risk levels associated with the unequal distribution of impacts, global aggregate impacts and large-scale singular events would be transitioning to high , those associated with extreme weather events would be transitioning to very high, and those associated with unique and threatened systems would be very high  . With about 2°C warming, climate-related changes in food availability and diet quality are estimated to increase nutrition-related diseases and the number of undernourished people, affecting tens to hundreds of millions of people, particularly among low-income households in low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Central America. For example, snowmelt water availability for irrigation is projected to decline in some snowmelt dependent river basins by up to 20% . Climate change risks to cities, settlements and key infrastructure will rise sharply in the mid and long term with further global warming, especially in places already exposed to high temperatures, along coastlines, or with high vulnerabilities .  At global warming of 3°C, additional risks in many sectors and regions reach high or very high levels, implying widespread systemic impacts, irreversible change and many additional adaptation limits . For example, very high extinction risk for endemic species in biodiversity hotspots is projected to increase at least tenfold if warming rises from 1.5°C to 3°C. Projected increases in direct flood damages are higher by 1.4 to 2 times at 2°C and 2.5 to 3.9 times at 3°C, compared to 1.5°C global warming without adaptation.  Global warming of 4°C and above is projected to lead to far-reaching impacts on natural and human systems. Beyond 4°C of warming, projected impacts on natural systems include local extinction of ~50% of tropical marine species and biome shifts across 35% of global land area. At this level of warming, approximately 10% of the global land area is projected to face both increasing high and decreasing low extreme streamflow, affecting, without additional adaptation, over 2.1 billion people and about 4 billion people are projected to experience water scarcity. At 4°C of warming, the global burned area is projected to increase by 50 to 70% and the fire frequency by ~30% compared to today.  Projected adverse impacts and related losses and damages from climate change escalate with every increment of global warming , but they will also strongly depend on socio-economic development trajectories and adaptation actions to reduce vulnerability and exposure. For example, development pathways with higher demand for food, animal feed, and water, more resource-intensive consumption and production, and limited technological improvements result in higher risks from water scarcity in drylands, land degradation and food insecurity . Changes in, for example, demography or investments in health systems have effect on a variety of health-related outcomes including heat-related morbidity and mortality.  With every increment of warming, climate change impacts and risks will become increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. Many regions are projected to experience an increase in the probability of compound events with higher global warming, such as concurrent heatwaves and droughts, compound flooding and fire weather. In addition, multiple climatic and non-climatic risk drivers such as biodiversity loss or violent conflict will interact, resulting in compounding overall risk and risks cascading across sectors and regions. Furthermore, risks can arise from some responses that are intended to reduce the risks of climate change, e.g., adverse side effects of some emission reduction and carbon dioxide removal measures .  Solar Radiation Modification approaches, if they were to be implemented, introduce a widespread range of new risks to people and ecosystems, which are not well understood. SRM has the potential to offset warming within one or two decades and ameliorate some climate hazards but would not restore climate to a previous state, and substantial residual or overcompensating climate change would occur at regional and seasonal scales. Effects of SRM would depend on the specific approach used 122, and a sudden and sustained termination of SRM in a high CO 2 emissions scenario would cause rapid climate change. SRM would not stop atmospheric CO 2 concentrations from increasing nor reduce resulting ocean acidification under continued anthropogenic emissions. Large uncertainties and knowledge gaps are associated with the potential of SRM approaches to reduce climate change risks. Lack of robust and formal SRM governance poses risks as deployment by a limited number of states could create international tensions. Overshoot Pathways: Increased Risks and Other  Implications Exceeding a specific remaining carbon budget results in higher global warming. Achieving and sustaining net negative global CO 2 emissions could reverse the resulting temperature exceedance. Continued reductions in emissions of short-lived climate forcers, particularly methane, after peak temperature has been reached, would also further reduce warming. Only a small number of the most ambitious global modelled pathways limit global warming to 1.5°C without overshoot.  Overshoot of a warming level results in more adverse impacts, some irreversible, and additional risks for human and natural systems compared to staying below that warming level, with risks growing with the magnitude and duration of overshoot.

Overshooting 1.5°C will result in irreversible adverse impacts on certain ecosystems with low resilience, such as polar, mountain, and coastal ecosystems, impacted by ice-sheet melt, glacier melt, or by accelerating and higher committed sea level rise.

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Returning after Overshoot
Text: Sectoral Contributions to Mitigation  All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 involve rapid and deep and in most cases immediate GHG emissions reductions in all sectors. Reductions in GHG emissions in industry, transport, buildings, and urban areas can be achieved through a combination of energy efficiency and conservation and a transition to low-GHG technologies and energy carriers. Socio-cultural options and behavioural change can reduce global GHG emissions of end-use sectors, with most of the potential in developed countries, if combined with improved infrastructure design and access.  Global modelled mitigation pathways reaching net zero CO2 and GHG emissions include transitioning from fossil fuels without carbon capture and storage to very low- or zero-carbon energy sources, such as renewables or fossil fuels with CCS, demand-side measures and improving efficiency, reducing non-CO2 GHG emissions, and CDR 136. In global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or below, almost all electricity is supplied from zero or low-carbon sources in 2050, such as renewables or fossil fuels with CO2 capture and storage, combined with increased electrification of energy demand. Such pathways meet energy service demand with relatively low energy use, through e.g., enhanced energy efficiency and behavioural changes and increased electrification of energy end use. Modelled global pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot generally implement such changes faster than pathways limiting global warming to 2°C.  AFOLU mitigation options, when sustainably implemented, can deliver large-scale GHG emission reductions and enhanced CO2 removal; however, barriers to implementation and trade-offs may result from the impacts of climate change, competing demands on land, conflicts with food security and livelihoods, the complexity of land ownership and management systems, and cultural aspects. All assessed modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 include land-based mitigation and land-use change, with most including different combinations of reforestation, afforestation, reduced deforestation, and bioenergy. However, accumulated carbon in vegetation and soils is at risk from future loss triggered by climate change and disturbances such as flood, drought, fire, or pest outbreaks, or future poor management.  In addition to deep, rapid, and sustained emission reductions, CDR can fulfil three complementary roles: lowering net CO2 or net GHG emissions in the near term; counterbalancing ‘hard-to-abate’ residual emissions  to help reach net zero CO2 or GHG emissions, and achieving net negative CO 2 or GHG emissions if deployed at levels exceeding annual residual emissions. CDR methods vary in terms of their maturity, removal process, time scale of carbon storage, storage medium, mitigation potential, cost, co-benefits, impacts and risks, and governance requirements. Specifically, maturity ranges from lower maturity to higher maturity; removal and storage potential ranges from lower potential to higher potential; costs range from lower cost to higher cost  . Estimated storage timescales vary from decades to centuries for methods that store carbon in vegetation and through soil carbon management, to ten thousand years or more for methods that store carbon in geological formations . Afforestation, reforestation, improved forest management, agroforestry and soil carbon sequestration are currently the only widely practiced CDR methods. Methods and levels of CDR deployment in global modelled mitigation pathways vary depending on assumptions about costs, availability and constraints. Overshoot Pathways: Increased Risks and Other  Implications Exceeding a specific remaining carbon budget results in higher global warming. Achieving and sustaining net negative global CO 2 emissions could reverse the resulting temperature exceedance. Continued reductions in emissions of short-lived climate forcers, particularly methane, after peak temperature has been reached, would also further reduce warming.

Synergies and trade-offs, costs and benefits  Mitigation and adaptation options can lead to synergies and trade-offs with other aspects of sustainable development . Synergies and trade-offs depend on the pace and magnitude of changes and the development context including inequalities, with consideration of climate justice.

Climate resilient development 138 pathways are progressively constrained by every increment of further warming. There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all. Advancing Integrated Climate Action for Sustainable  Development An inclusive, equitable approach to integrating adaptation, mitigation and development can advance sustainable development in the long term. Integrated responses can harness synergies for sustainable development and reduce trade-offs. Shifting development pathways towards sustainability and advancing climate resilient development is enabled when governments, civil society and the private sector make development choices that prioritise risk reduction, equity and justice, and when decision-making processes, finance and actions are integrated across governance levels, sectors and timeframes. Inclusive processes involving local knowledge and Indigenous Knowledge increase these prospects. However, opportunities for action differ substantially among and within regions, driven by historical and ongoing patterns of development. Accelerated financial support for developing countries is critical to enhance mitigation and adaptation action.  Policies that shift development pathways towards sustainability can broaden the portfolio of available mitigation and adaptation responses. Combining mitigation with action to shift development pathways, such as broader sectoral policies, approaches that induce lifestyle or behaviour changes, financial regulation, or macroeconomic policies can overcome barriers and open up a broader range of mitigation options. Integrated, inclusive planning and investment in everyday decisionmaking about urban infrastructure can significantly increase the adaptive capacity of urban and rural settlements. Coastal cities and settlements play an important role in advancing climate resilient development due to the high number of people living in the Low Elevation Coastal Zone, the escalating and climate compounded risk that they face, and their vital role in national economies and beyond .  Observed adverse impacts and related losses and damages, projected risks, trends in vulnerability, and adaptation limits demonstrate that transformation for sustainability and climate resilient development action is more urgent than previously assessed. Climate resilient development integrates adaptation and GHG mitigation to advance sustainable development for all. Climate resilient development pathways have been constrained by past development, emissions and climate change and are progressively constrained by every increment of warming, in particular beyond 1.5°C. Climate resilient development will not be possible in some regions and sub-regions if global warming exceeds 2°C. Safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystems is fundamental to climate resilient development, but biodiversity and ecosystem services have limited capacity to adapt to increasing global warming levels, making climate resilient development progressively harder to achieve beyond 1.5°C warming.  The cumulative scientific evidence is unequivocal: climate change is a threat to human well-being and planetary health . Any further delay in concerted anticipatory global action on adaptation and mitigation will miss a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all. Opportunities for near-term action are assessed in the following section. The Timing and Urgency of Climate Action  The magnitude and rate of climate change and associated risks depend strongly on near-term mitigation and adaptation actions . Global warming is more likely than not to reach 1.5°C between 2021 and 2040 even under the very low GHG emission scenarios, and likely or very likely to exceed 1.5°C under higher emissions scenarios 141. Many adaptation options have medium or high feasibility up to 1.5°C , but hard limits to adaptation have already been reached in some ecosystems and the effectiveness of adaptation to reduce climate risk will decrease with increasing warming. Societal choices and actions implemented in this decade determine the extent to which medium- and long-term pathways will deliver higher or lower climate resilient development. Climate resilient development prospects are increasingly limited if current greenhouse gas emissions do not rapidly decline, especially if 1.5°C global warming is exceeded in the near term. Without urgent, effective and equitable adaptation and mitigation actions, climate change increasingly threatens the health and livelihoods of people around the globe, ecosystem health, and biodiversity, with severe adverse consequences for current and future generations. .  In modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot and in those that limit warming to 2°C, assuming immediate actions, global GHG emissions are projected to peak in the early 2020s followed by rapid and deep GHG emissions reductions 142 . In pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, net global GHG emissions are projected to fall by 43 [34 to 60]%143 below 2019 levels by 2030, 60 [49 to 77]% by 2035, 69 [58 to 90]% by 2040 and 84 [73 to 98]% by 2050 144. Global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C have reductions in GHG emissions below 2019 levels of 21 [1 to 42]% by 2030, 35 [22 to 55] % by 2035, 46 [34 to 63] % by 2040 and 64 [53 to 77]% by 2050145. Global GHG emissions associated with NDCs announced prior to COP26 would make it likely that warming would exceed 1.5°C and limiting warming to 2°C would then imply a rapid acceleration of emission reductions during 2030–2050, around 70% faster than in pathways where immediate action is taken to limit warming to 2°C Continued investments in unabated high-emitting infrastructure and limited development and deployment of low-emitting alternatives prior to 2030 would act as barriers to this acceleration and increase feasibility risks.  All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 involve reductions in both net CO 2 emissions and non-CO 2 emissions. For example, in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, global CH4 emissions are reduced by 34 [21 to 57]% below 2019 levels by 2030 and by 44 [31 to 63]% in 2040. Global CH 4 emissions are reduced by 24 [9 to 53]% below 2019 levels by 2030 and by 37 [20 to 60]% in 2040 in modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C with action starting in 2020.  All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 involve GHG emission reductions in all sectors . The contributions of different sectors vary across modelled mitigation pathways. In most global modelled mitigation pathways, emissions from land-use, land-use change and forestry, via reforestation and reduced deforestation, and from the energy supply sector reach net zero CO2 emissions earlier than the buildings, industry and transport sectors. Strategies can rely on combinations of different options, but doing less in one sector needs to be compensated by further reductions in other sectors if warming is to be limited.  Without rapid, deep and sustained mitigation and accelerated adaptation actions, losses and damages will continue to increase, including projected adverse impacts in Africa, LDCs, SIDS, Central and South America , Asia and the Arctic, and will disproportionately affect the most vulnerable populations .<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Risks of Continued Emissions
Text: Sure, here's a summary of the main takeaways from the text with respect to the topic:  * The likelihood of abrupt and irreversible changes and their impacts increase with higher global warming levels.   * Sea level rise is unavoidable for centuries to millennia due to continuing deep ocean warming and ice sheet melt.   * Global mean sea level rise will continue in the 21st century, with projected regional relative sea level rise within 20% of the global mean along two-thirds of the global coastline.   * The magnitude, the rate, the timing of threshold exceedances, and the long-term commitment of sea level rise depend on emissions, with higher emissions leading to greater and faster rates of sea level rise.   * The probability of low-likelihood outcomes associated with potentially very large impacts increases with higher global warming levels.   * Global mean sea level rise above the likely range – approaching 2 m by 2100 and in excess of 15 m by 2300 under a very high GHG emissions scenario – cannot be ruled out due to deep uncertainty in ice-sheet processes.<eos> Sure, here's a summary of the main takeaways from the text with respect to the topic:  * Rapid and deep emissions reductions in all sectors are crucial for achieving net-zero emissions by 2100.   * Transitioning to low-carbon energy sources, energy efficiency, and behavioral changes can significantly reduce emissions in various sectors.   * Achieving net-zero emissions requires a combination of deep emissions reductions, land-based mitigation, and carbon capture and storage (CDR) methods.   * CDR offers multiple benefits, including near-term emission reductions, balancing residual emissions, and achieving net-negative emissions.   * The effectiveness of CDR methods depends on factors such as maturity, removal potential, cost, and governance requirements.   * Afforestation, reforestation, and soil carbon sequestration are currently the most widely practiced CDR methods.<eos> Sure, here's a summary of the main takeaways from the text with respect to the topic:  * Synergies and trade-offs exist between sustainable development and various other aspects of sustainable development. * Some adaptation and mitigation options have mixed impacts on sustainability, while others have positive impacts. * The global benefits of limiting warming to 2°C exceed the cost of mitigation. * Considering other sustainable development dimensions, such as the potentially strong economic benefits on human health from air quality improvement, may enhance the estimated benefits of mitigation. * The economic effects of strengthened mitigation action vary across regions and countries, depending notably on economic structure, regional emissions reductions, policy design and level of international cooperation.<eos> Sure, here's a summary of the main takeaways from the text with respect to the topic:  * Climate change is more likely to exceed 1.5°C even under low emissions scenarios, and likely or very likely to exceed 1.5°C under higher emissions scenarios.   * Urgent and effective mitigation and adaptation actions are needed to limit warming to 1.5°C.   * Net global GHG emissions are projected to fall by 43-60% below 2019 levels by 2030, 60-77% by 2035, 69-90% by 2040, and 84-98% by 2050 under a 1.5°C warming limit.   * Global GHG emissions associated with NDCs announced prior to COP26 would make it likely that warming would exceed 1.5°C.   * Continued investments in unabated high-emitting infrastructure and limited development and deployment of low-emitting alternatives prior to 2030 would act as barriers to this acceleration and increase feasibility risks.   * All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 involve reductions in both net CO 2 emissions and non-CO 2 emissions.<eos> Sure, here's a summary of the main takeaways from the text with respect to the topic:  * **Benefits of near-term

mitigation strategy**: The text acknowledges that adaptation can help mitigate some climate change risks, but it emphasizes that it is not a substitute for reducing emissions.   * **Unfair distribution of losses and damages**: The text highlights that losses and damages will be unequally distributed across systems, regions, and sectors, and that current financial and governance arrangements do not adequately address these inequities.<eos> Sure, here's a summary of the main takeaways from the text with respect to the topic:  * **Equity, inclusion, and just transitions are key to achieving sustainable outcomes.** These principles ensure that climate action is inclusive and benefits all people, regardless of their socioeconomic status, gender, or other factors.   * **Adaptation is essential to address the risks of rising climate risks.** Adaptation actions can reduce the negative impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels, more extreme weather events, and food shortages.   * **Addressing the root causes of inequality, such as poverty and inequality, is crucial for effective climate action.** This can be achieved through policies that promote economic growth, access to education and healthcare, and social safety nets.   * **The design of climate policies should be equitable and inclusive.** This means considering the needs of vulnerable communities and ensuring that they have a fair share of benefits and burdens.   * **Broadening equitable access to finance, technologies, and governance is essential for effective climate action.** This can help to reduce emissions and promote sustainable development.   * **Behavioural interventions, such as taxes, subsidies, and consumption-based approaches, can be used to promote low-carbon behaviours.** These interventions can be designed to be equitable and ensure that everyone has access to them.   * **Technology development and transfer can help to reduce emissions and promote sustainable development.** This can be achieved by supporting developing countries/regions leapfrogging or transitioning to low-emissions transport systems.<eos><end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Risks of Delayed Mitigation
Text: Sure, here are the main takeaways from the text:  * Human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land. * Ocean warming has contributed to a decrease in maximum catch potential. * Climate change has caused substantial damages to human health globally and mental health in assessed regions. * Human vulnerability to climate change is higher in locations with poverty, governance challenges and limited access to basic services and resources. * Climate change impacts are already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. * The most vulnerable people and systems have been disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change. * Climate change has caused widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people.<eos> Sure, here's a summary of the main takeaways from the text with respect to the topic:  * Climate-related risks are higher for global warming of 1.5°C than at present but lower than at 2°C. * Climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth are projected to increase with global warming of 1.5°C. * At 2°C of global warming, overall risk levels associated with the unequal distribution of impacts, global aggregate impacts and large-scale singular events would be transitioning to high , those associated with extreme weather events would be transitioning to very high, and those associated with unique and threatened systems would be very high. * With about 2°C warming, climate change risks to cities, settlements and key infrastructure will rise sharply in the mid and long term with further global warming, especially in places already exposed to high temperatures, along coastlines, or with high vulnerabilities. * Global warming of 3°C and above is projected to lead to far-reaching impacts on natural and human systems. * With every increment of warming, climate change impacts and risks will become increasingly complex and more difficult to manage.<eos> Sure, here's a summary of the main takeaways from the text with respect to the topic:  * **Risks of delayed mitigation:** Adaptation options will become more constrained and less effective with increasing warming, leading to increased losses and damages.   * **Integrated, cross-cutting solutions:** Addressing climate risks through integrated and multi-sectoral solutions increases the effectiveness of adaptation.   * **Maladaptation can create lock-ins:** Maladaptive responses to climate change can exacerbate existing inequalities and create challenges to adaptation efforts.   * **Long-term planning and implementation:** Flexible, multi-sectoral, inclusive, and long-term planning and implementation are crucial for effective adaptation.   * **Sea level rise challenges:** Sea level rise poses unique adaptation challenges due to both slow onset changes and increased frequency and magnitude of extreme sea level events.   * **Ecosystem-based solutions:** While ecosystem-based solutions provide co-benefits, they have site-specific physical limits and lose effectiveness at high rates of sea level rise.   * **Adaptive planning and community engagement:** Planning and implementing adaptation actions with benefits to many sectors and engaging communities are essential for success.<eos> Sure, here's a summary of the main takeaways from the text with respect to the topic:  * A finite carbon budget exists, and exceeding it would lead to exceeding the maximum allowable warming level. * The best estimates of the remaining carbon budget from the beginning of 2020 for limiting warming to 1.5°C with a 50% likelihood is estimated to be 500 GtCO2; for 2°C this is 1150 GtCO2.128. * Reducing non-CO2 emissions can help reduce the temperature rise and the resulting carbon emissions. * The remaining carbon budget is lower when CO2 emissions are increasing. * Natural land and ocean carbon sinks are projected to become less effective at slowing the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere as cumulative net CO2 emissions increase.<eos> Sure, here's a summary of the main takeaways from the text with respect to the topic:  * Global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower involve rapid and deep emission reductions in all sectors.   * Reductions in GHG emissions in industry, transport, buildings, and urban areas can be achieved through a combination of energy efficiency and conservation and a transition to low-GHG technologies and energy carriers.   * The transition to net-zero CO2 and GHG emissions by 2100 can be achieved through transitioning from fossil fuels without carbon capture and storage to very low- or zero-carbon energy sources, such as renewables or fossil fuels with

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Reaching Net Zero CO2
Text: Energy Systems  Rapid and deep reductions in GHG emissions require major energy system transitions. Adaptation options can help reduce climate-related risks to the energy system . Net zero CO2 energy systems entail: a substantial reduction in overall fossil fuel use, minimal use of unabated fossil fuels 153, and use of Carbon Capture and Storage in the remaining fossil fuel systems; electricity systems that emit no net CO 2; widespread electrification; alternative energy carriers in applications less amenable to electrification; energy conservation and efficiency; and greater integration across the energy system . Large contributions to emissions reductions can come from options costing less than USD 20 tCO 2 -eq –1, including solar and wind energy, energy efficiency improvements, and CH4 emissions reductions  . 154 Many of these response options are technically viable and are supported by the public. Maintaining emission-intensive systems may, in some regions and sectors, be more expensive than transitioning to low emission systems.  Climate change and related extreme events will affect future energy systems, including hydropower production, bioenergy yields, thermal power plant efficiencies, and demands for heating and cooling . The most feasible energy system adaptation options support infrastructure resilience, reliable power systems and efficient water use for existing and new energy generation systems . Adaptations for hydropower and thermo-electric power generation are effective in most regions up to 1.5°C to 2°C, with decreasing effectiveness at higher levels of warming . Energy generation diversification  and demand side management  can increase energy reliability and reduce vulnerabilities to climate change, especially in rural populations . Climate responsive energy markets, updated design standards on energy assets according to current and projected climate change, smart-grid technologies, robust transmission systems and improved capacity to respond to supply deficits have high feasibility in the medium- to long-term, with mitigation co-benefits .<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Reducing GHG Emissions
Text: Industry  There are several options to reduce industrial emissions that differ by type of industry; many industries are disrupted by climate change, especially from extreme events . Reducing industry emissions will entail coordinated action throughout value chains to promote all mitigation options, including demand management, energy and materials efficiency, circular material flows, as well as abatement technologies and transformational changes in production processes. Light industry and manufacturing can be largely decarbonized through available abatement technologies, electrification, and switching to low- and zero-GHG emitting fuels  , while deep reduction of cement process emissions will rely on cementitious material substitution and the availability of Carbon Capture and Storage until new chemistries are mastered. Reducing emissions from the production and use of chemicals would need to rely on a life cycle approach, including increased plastics recycling, fuel and feedstock switching, and carbon sourced through biogenic sources, and, depending on availability, Carbon Capture and Utilisation, direct air CO2 capture, as well as CCS. Action to reduce industry sector emissions may change the location of GHG-intensive industries and the organisation of value chains, with distributional effects on employment and economic structure.  Many industrial and service sectors are negatively affected by climate change through supply and operational disruptions, especially from extreme events, and will require adaptation efforts. Water intensive industries can undertake measures to reduce water stress, such as water recycling and reuse, using brackish or saline sources, working to improve water use efficiency. However, residual risks will remain, especially at higher levels of warming . Cities, Settlements and Infrastructure  Urban systems are critical for achieving deep emissions reductions and advancing climate resilient development, particularly when this involves integrated planning that incorporates physical, natural and social infrastructure . Deep emissions reductions and integrated adaptation actions are advanced by: integrated, inclusive land use planning and decision-making; compact urban form by co-locating jobs and housing; reducing or changing urban energy and material consumption; electrification in combination with low emissions sources; improved water and waste management infrastructure; and enhancing carbon uptake and storage in the urban environment . Cities can achieve net zero emissions if emissions are reduced within and outside of their administrative boundaries through supply chains, creating beneficial cascading effects across other sectors.  Considering climate change impacts and risks  in the design and planning of urban and rural settlements and infrastructure is critical for resilience and enhancing human well-being. Effective mitigation can be advanced at each of the design, construction, retrofit, use and disposal stages for buildings. Mitigation interventions for buildings include: at the construction phase, lowemission construction materials, highly efficient building envelope and the integration of renewable energy solutions; at the use phase, highly efficient appliances/equipment, the optimisation of the use of buildings and their supply with low-emission energy sources; and at the disposal phase, recycling and re-using construction materials. Sufficiency 155 measures can limit the demand for energy and materials over the lifecycle of buildings and appliances.   Transport-related GHG emissions can be reduced by demand-side options and low-GHG emissions technologies. Changes in urban form, reallocation of street space for cycling and walking, digitalisation and programs that encourage changes in consumer behaviour can reduce demand for transport services and support the shift to more energy efficient transport modes. Electric vehicles powered by low-emissions electricity offer the largest decarbonisation potential for land-based transport, on a life cycle basis. Costs of electrified vehicles are decreasing and their adoption is accelerating, but they require continued investments in supporting infrastructure to increase scale of deployment. The environmental footprint of battery production and growing concerns about critical minerals can be addressed by material and supply diversification strategies, energy and material efficiency improvements, and circular material flows . Advances in battery technologies could facilitate the electrification of heavy-duty trucks and compliment conventional electric rail systems. Sustainable biofuels can offer additional mitigation benefits in land-based transport in the short and medium term. Sustainable biofuels, low-emissions hydrogen, and derivatives can support mitigation of CO2 emissions from shipping, aviation, and heavy-duty land transport but require production process improvements and cost reductions. Key infrastructure systems including sanitation, water, health, transport, communications and energy will be increasingly vulnerable if design standards do not account for changing climate conditions.  Green/natural and blue infrastructure such as urban forestry, green roofs, ponds and lakes, and river restoration can mitigate climate change through carbon uptake and storage, avoided emissions, and reduced energy use while reducing risk from extreme events such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation and droughts, and advancing co-benefits for health, well-being and livelihoods. Urban greening can provide local cooling. Combining green/natural and grey/physical infrastructure adaptation responses has potential to reduce adaptation costs and contribute to flood control, sanitation, water resources management, landslide prevention and coastal protection. Globally, more financing is directed at grey/physical infrastructure than green/natural infrastructure and social infrastructure, and there is limited evidence of investment in informal settlements . The greatest gains in well-being in urban areas can be achieved by prioritising finance to reduce climate risk for low-income and marginalised communities including people living in informal settlements.  Responses to ongoing sea level rise and land subsidence in low-lying coastal cities and settlements and small islands include protection, accommodation, advance and planned relocation.

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Agricolture, Forestry and Land Use
Text: Land, Ocean, Food, and Water  There is substantial mitigation and adaptation potential from options in agriculture, forestry and other land use, and in the oceans, that could be upscaled in the near term across most regions. Conservation, improved management, and restoration of forests and other ecosystems offer the largest share of economic mitigation potential, with reduced deforestation in tropical regions having the highest total mitigation potential. Ecosystem restoration, reforestation, and afforestation can lead to trade-offs due to competing demands on land. Minimizing trade-offs requires integrated approaches to meet multiple objectives including food security. Demand-side measures  and sustainable agricultural intensification can reduce ecosystem conversion and CH4 and N2 O emissions, and free up land for reforestation and ecosystem restoration. Sustainably sourced agriculture and forest products, including long-lived wood products, can be used instead of more GHG-intensive products in other sectors. Effective adaptation options include cultivar improvements, agroforestry, community-based adaptation, farm and landscape diversification, and urban agriculture. These AFOLU response options require integration of biophysical, socioeconomic and other enabling factors. The effectiveness of ecosystem-based adaptation and most water-related adaptation options declines with increasing warming.  Some options, such as conservation of high-carbon ecosystems , have immediate impacts while others, such as restoration of high-carbon ecosystems, reclamation of degraded soils or afforestation, take decades to deliver measurable results. Many sustainable land management technologies and practices are financially profitable in three to ten years.  Maintaining the resilience of biodiversity and ecosystem services at a global scale depends on effective and equitable conservation of approximately 30–50% of Earth’s land, freshwater and ocean areas, including currently near-natural ecosystems. The services and options provided by terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and ocean ecosystems can be supported by protection, restoration, precautionary ecosystem-based management of renewable resource use, and the reduction of pollution and other stressors.  Large-scale land conversion for bioenergy, biochar, or afforestation can increase risks to biodiversity, water and food security. In contrast, restoring natural forests and drained peatlands, and improving sustainability of managed forests enhances the resilience of carbon stocks and sinks and reduces ecosystem vulnerability to climate change. Cooperation, and inclusive decision making, with local communities and Indigenous Peoples, as well as recognition of inherent rights of Indigenous Peoples, is integral to successful adaptation across forests and other ecosystems.  Natural rivers, wetlands and upstream forests reduce flood risk in most circumstances. Enhancing natural water retention such as by restoring wetlands and rivers, land use planning such as no build zones or upstream forest management, can further reduce flood risk . For inland flooding, combinations of non-structural measures like early warning systems and structural measures like levees have reduced loss of lives, but hard defences against flooding or sea level rise can also be maladaptive .  Protection and restoration of coastal ‘blue carbon’ ecosystems could reduce emissions and/or increase carbon uptake and storage . Coastal wetlands protect against coastal erosion and flooding. Strengthening precautionary approaches, such as rebuilding overexploited or depleted fisheries, and responsiveness of existing fisheries management strategies reduces negative climate change impacts on fisheries, with benefits for regional economies and livelihoods. Ecosystem-based management in fisheries and aquaculture supports food security, biodiversity, human health and well-being.<end_of_turn>

Ecosystem-based management in fisheries and aquaculture supports food security, biodiversity, human health and well-being. Co-Benefits of Adaptation and Mitigation for Sustainable Development Goals  Mitigation and adaptation actions have more synergies than trade-offs with Sustainable Development Goals . Synergies and trade-offs depend on context and scale of implementation. Potential trade-offs can be compensated or avoided with additional policies, investments and financial partnerships. Many mitigation and adaptation actions have multiple synergies with Sustainable Development Goals, but some actions can also have trade-offs. Potential synergies with SDGs exceed potential trade-offs. Synergies and trade-offs are context specific and depend on: means and scale of implementation, intra- and inter-sectoral interactions, cooperation between countries and regions, the sequencing, timing and stringency of actions, governance, and policy design. Eradicating extreme poverty, energy poverty, and providing decent living standards to all, consistent with nearterm sustainable development objectives, can be achieved without significant global emissions growth.  Several mitigation and adaptation options can harness nearterm synergies and reduce trade-offs to advance sustainable development in energy, urban and land systems . Clean energy supply systems have multiple co-benefits, including improvements in air quality and health. Heat Health Action Plans that include early warning and response systems, approaches that mainstream health into food, livelihoods, social protection, water and sanitation benefit health and wellbeing. There are potential synergies between multiple Sustainable Development Goals and sustainable land use and urban planning with more green spaces, reduced air pollution, and demand-side mitigation including shifts to balanced, sustainable healthy diets. Electrification combined with low-GHG energy, and shifts to public transport can enhance health, employment, and can contribute to energy security and deliver equity. Conservation, protection and restoration of terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and ocean ecosystems, together with targeted management to adapt to unavoidable impacts of climate change can generate multiple additional benefits, such as agricultural productivity, food security, and biodiversity conservation.  When implementing mitigation and adaptation together, and taking trade-offs into account, multiple co-benefits and synergies for human well-being as well as ecosystem and planetary health can be realised. There is a strong link between sustainable development, vulnerability and climate risks. Social safety nets that support climate change adaptation have strong co-benefits with development goals such as education, poverty alleviation, gender inclusion and food security. Land restoration contributes to mitigation and adaptation with synergies via enhanced ecosystem services and with economically positive returns and co-benefits for poverty reduction and improved livelihoods. Trade-offs can be evaluated and minimised by giving emphasis to capacity building, finance, technology transfer, investments; governance, development, context specific gender-based and other social equity considerations with meaningful participation of Indigenous Peoples, local communities and vulnerable populations. .  Context relevant design and implementation requires considering people’s needs, biodiversity, and other sustainable development dimensions. Countries at all stages of economic development seek to improve the well-being of people, and their development priorities reflect different starting points and contexts. Different contexts include but are not limited to social, economic, environmental, cultural, or political circumstances, resource endowment, capabilities, international environment, and prior development. n regions with high dependency on fossil fuels for, among other things, revenue and employment generation, mitigating risks for sustainable development requires policies that promote economic and energy sector diversification and considerations of just transitions principles, processes and practices. For individuals and households in low-lying coastal areas, in Small Islands, and smallholder farmers transitioning from incremental to transformational adaptation can help overcome soft adaptation limits. Effective governance is needed to limit trade-offs of some mitigation options such as large scale afforestation and bioenergy options due to risks from their deployment for food systems, biodiversity, other ecosystem functions and services, and livelihoods. Effective governance requires adequate institutional capacity at all levels .<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Human Health
Text: Health and Nutrition  Human health will benefit from integrated mitigation and adaptation options that mainstream health into food, infrastructure, social protection, and water policies . Balanced and sustainable healthy diets and reduced food loss and waste present important opportunities for adaptation and mitigation while generating significant co-benefits in terms of biodiversity and human health. Public health policies to improve nutrition, such as increasing the diversity of food sources in public procurement, health insurance, financial incentives, and awareness-raising campaigns, can potentially influence food demand, reduce food waste, reduce healthcare costs, contribute to lower GHG emissions and enhance adaptive capacity. Improved access to clean energy sources and technologies, and shifts to active mobility and public transport can deliver socioeconomic, air quality and health benefits, especially for women and children.  Effective adaptation options exist to help protect human health and well-being. Health Action Plans that include early warning and response systems are effective for extreme heat . Effective options for water-borne and food-borne diseases include improving access to potable water, reducing exposure of water and sanitation systems to flooding and extreme weather events, and improved early warning systems. For vector-borne diseases, effective adaptation options include surveillance, early warning systems, and vaccine development. Effective adaptation options for reducing mental health risks under climate change include improving surveillance and access to mental health care, and monitoring of psychosocial impacts from extreme weather events. A key pathway to climate resilience in the health sector is universal access to healthcare.<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Policies
Text: Society, Livelihoods, and Economies  Enhancing knowledge on risks and available adaptation options promotes societal responses, and behaviour and lifestyle changes supported by policies, infrastructure and technology can help reduce global GHG emissions. Climate literacy and information provided through climate services and community approaches, including those that are informed by Indigenous Knowledge and local knowledge, can accelerate behavioural changes and planning . Educational and information programmes, using the arts, participatory modelling and citizen science can facilitate awareness, heighten risk perception, and influence behaviours . The way choices are presented can enable adoption of low GHG intensive socio-cultural options, such as shifts to balanced, sustainable healthy diets, reduced food waste, and active mobility. Judicious labelling, framing, and communication of social norms can increase the effect of mandates, subsidies, or taxes.  A range of adaptation options, such as disaster risk management, early warning systems, climate services and risk spreading and sharing approaches, have broad applicability across sectors and provide greater risk reduction benefits when combined . Climate services that are demand-driven and inclusive of different users and providers can improve agricultural practices, inform better water use and efficiency, and enable resilient infrastructure planning. Policy mixes that include weather and health insurance, social protection and adaptive safety nets, contingent finance and reserve funds, and universal access to early warning systems combined with effective contingency plans, can reduce vulnerability and exposure of human systems. Integrating climate adaptation into social protection programs, including cash transfers and public works programs, is highly feasible and increases resilience to climate change, especially when supported by basic services and infrastructure. Social safety nets can build adaptive capacities, reduce socioeconomic vulnerability, and reduce risk linked to hazards.  Reducing future risks of involuntary migration and displacement due to climate change is possible through cooperative, international efforts to enhance institutional adaptive capacity and sustainable development. Increasing adaptive capacity minimises risk associated with involuntary migration and immobility and improves the degree of choice under which migration decisions are made, while policy interventions can remove barriers and expand the alternatives for safe, orderly and regular migration that allows vulnerable people to adapt to climate change.  Accelerating commitment and follow-through by the private sector is promoted for instance by building business cases for adaptation, accountability and transparency mechanisms, and monitoring and evaluation of adaptation progress . Integrated pathways for managing climate risks will be most suitable when so-called ‘low-regret’ anticipatory options are established jointly across sectors in a timely manner and are feasible and effective in their local context, and when path dependencies and maladaptations across sectors are avoided. Sustained adaptation actions are strengthened by mainstreaming adaptation into institutional budget and policy planning cycles, statutory planning, monitoring and evaluation frameworks and into recovery efforts from disaster events. Instruments that incorporate adaptation such as policy and legal frameworks, behavioural incentives, and economic instruments that address market failures, such as climate risk disclosure, inclusive and deliberative processes strengthen adaptation actions by public and private actors.<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Equity
Text: Equity and Inclusion in Climate Change Action  Actions that prioritise equity, climate justice, social justice and inclusion lead to more sustainable outcomes, co-benefits, reduce trade-offs, support transformative change and advance climate resilient development. Adaptation responses are immediately needed to reduce rising climate risks, especially for the most vulnerable. Equity, inclusion and just transitions are key to progress on adaptation and deeper societal ambitions for accelerated mitigation. Adaptation and mitigation actions, across scales, sectors and regions, that prioritise equity, climate justice, rights-based approaches, social justice and inclusivity, lead to more sustainable outcomes, reduce trade-offs, support transformative change and advance climate resilient development . Redistributive policies across sectors and regions that shield the poor and vulnerable, social safety nets, equity, inclusion and just transitions, at all scales can enable deeper societal ambitions and resolve trade-offs with sustainable development goals., particularly education, hunger, poverty, gender and energy access . Mitigation efforts embedded within the wider development context can increase the pace, depth and breadth of emission reductions . Equity, inclusion and just transitions at all scales enable deeper societal ambitions for accelerated mitigation, and climate action more broadly. The complexity in risk of rising food prices, reduced household incomes, and health and climate-related malnutrition  and mortality increases with little or low levels of adaptation.  Regions and people with considerable development constraints have high vulnerability to climatic hazards. Adaptation outcomes for the most vulnerable within and across countries and regions are enhanced through approaches focusing on equity, inclusivity, and rights-based approaches, including 3.3 to 3.6 billion people living in contexts that are highly vulnerable to climate change. Vulnerability is higher in locations with poverty, governance challenges and limited access to basic services and resources, violent conflict and high levels of climate-sensitive livelihoods  . Several risks can be moderated with adaptation. The largest adaptation gaps exist among lower income population groups and adaptation progress is unevenly distributed with observed adaptation gaps. Present development challenges causing high vulnerability are influenced by historical and ongoing patterns of inequity such as colonialism, especially for many Indigenous Peoples and local communities. Vulnerability is exacerbated by inequity and marginalisation linked to gender, ethnicity, low income or combinations thereof, especially for many Indigenous Peoples and local communities.  Meaningful participation and inclusive planning, informed by cultural values, Indigenous Knowledge, local knowledge, and scientific knowledge can help address adaptation gaps and avoid maladaptation. Such actions with flexible pathways may encourage low-regret and timely actions . Integrating climate adaptation into social protection programmes, including cash transfers and public works programmes, would increase resilience to climate change, especially when supported by basic services and infrastructure.  Equity, inclusion, just transitions, broad and meaningful participation of all relevant actors in decision making at all scales enable deeper societal ambitions for accelerated mitigation, and climate action more broadly, and build social trust, support transformative changes and an equitable sharing of benefits and burdens. Equity remains a central element in the UN climate regime, notwithstanding shifts in differentiation between states over time and challenges in assessing fair shares. Ambitious mitigation pathways imply large and sometimes disruptive changes in economic structure, with significant distributional consequences, within and between countries, including shifting of income and employment during the transition from high to low emissions activities. While some jobs may be lost, low-emissions development can also open up opportunities to enhance skills and create jobs. Broadening equitable access to finance, technologies and governance that facilitate mitigation, and consideration of climate justice can help equitable sharing of benefits and burdens, especially for vulnerable countries and communities.  Development priorities among countries also reflect different starting points and contexts, and enabling conditions for shifting development pathways towards increased sustainability will therefore differ, giving rise to different needs . Implementing just transition principles through collective and participatory decision-making processes is an effective way of integrating equity principles into policies at all scales depending on national circumstances, while in several countries just transition commissions, task forces and national policies have been established .  Many economic and regulatory instruments have been effective in reducing emissions and practical experience has informed instrument design to improve them while addressing distributional goals and social acceptance. The design of behavioural interventions, including the way that choices are presented to consumers work synergistically with price signals, making the combination more effective. Individuals with high socio-economic status contribute disproportionately to emissions, and have the highest potential for emissions reductions, e.g., as citizens, investors, consumers, role models, and professionals . There are options on design of instruments such as taxes, subsidies, prices, and consumption-based approaches, complemented by regulatory instruments to reduce high-emissions consumption while improving equity and societal well-being. Behaviour and lifestyle changes to help end-users adopt low-GHG-intensive options can be supported by policies, infrastructure and technology with multiple co-benefits for societal well-being. Broadening equitable access to domestic and international finance, technologies and capacity can also act as a catalyst for accelerating mitigation and shifting development pathways in low-income contexts . Eradicating extreme poverty, energy poverty, and providing decent living standards to all in these regions in the context of achieving sustainable development objectives, in the near term, can be achieved without significant global emissions growth. Technology development, transfer, capacity building and financing can support developing countries/ regions leapfrogging or transitioning to low-emissions transport systems thereby providing multiple co-benefits . Climate resilient development is advanced when actors work in equitable, just and enabling ways to reconcile divergent interests, values and worldviews, toward equitable and just outcomes .<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Regulations
Text: Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution  Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals. Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related losses and damages to nature and people. Vulnerable communities who have historically contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected. Equity and Inclusion in Climate Change Action  Actions that prioritise equity, climate justice, social justice and inclusion lead to more sustainable outcomes, co-benefits, reduce trade-offs, support transformative change and advance climate resilient development. Adaptation responses are immediately needed to reduce rising climate risks, especially for the most vulnerable.

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Insitutions
Text: Responses Undertaken to Date  International climate agreements, rising national ambitions for climate action, along with rising public awareness are accelerating efforts to address climate change at multiple levels of governance. Mitigation policies have contributed to a decrease in global energy and carbon intensity, with several countries achieving GHG emission reductions for over a decade. Low-emission technologies are becoming more affordable, with many low or zero emissions options now available for energy, buildings, transport, and industry. Adaptation planning and implementation progress has generated multiple benefits, with effective adaptation options having the potential to reduce climate risks and contribute to sustainable development. Global tracked finance for mitigation and adaptation has seen an upward trend since AR5, but falls short of needs. Governance and Policy for Near-Term Climate Change Action  Effective climate action requires political commitment, well-aligned multi-level governance and institutional frameworks, laws, policies and strategies. It needs clear goals, adequate finance and financing tools, coordination across multiple policy domains, and inclusive governance processes. Many mitigation and adaptation policy instruments have been deployed successfully, and could support deep emissions reductions and climate resilience if scaled up and applied widely, depending on national circumstances. Adaptation and mitigation action benefits from drawing on diverse knowledge. Effective climate governance enables mitigation and adaptation by providing overall direction based on national circumstances, setting targets and priorities, mainstreaming climate action across policy domains and levels, based on national circumstances and in the context of international cooperation. Effective governance enhances monitoring and evaluation and regulatory certainty, prioritising inclusive, transparent and equitable decision-making, and improves access to finance and technology. These functions can be promoted by climate-relevant laws and plans, which are growing in number across sectors and regions, advancing mitigation outcomes and adaptation benefits . Climate laws have been growing in number and have helped deliver mitigation and adaptation outcomes .  Effective municipal, national and sub-national climate institutions, such as expert and co-ordinating bodies, enable co-produced, multi-scale decision-processes, build consensus for action among diverse interests, and inform strategy settings . This requires adequate institutional capacity at all levels. Vulnerabilities and climate risks are often reduced through carefully designed and implemented laws, policies, participatory processes, and interventions that address context specific inequities such as based on gender, ethnicity, disability, age, location and income. Policy support is influenced by Indigenous Peoples, businesses, and actors in civil society, including, youth, labour, media, and local communities, and effectiveness is enhanced by partnerships between many different groups in society . Climate-related litigation is growing, with a large number of cases in some developed countries and with a much smaller number in some developing countries, and in some cases has influenced the outcome and ambition of climate governance.  Effective climate governance is enabled by inclusive decision processes, allocation of appropriate resources, and institutional review, monitoring and evaluation. Multi-level, hybrid and cross-sector governance facilitates appropriate consideration for co-benefits and trade-offs, particularly in land sectors where decision processes range from farm level to national scale. Consideration of climate justice can help to facilitate shifting development pathways towards sustainability.  Drawing on diverse knowledge and partnerships, including with women, youth, Indigenous Peoples, local communities, and ethnic minorities can facilitate climate resilient development and has allowed locally appropriate and socially acceptable solutions.  Many regulatory and economic instruments have already been deployed successfully. These instruments could support deep emissions reductions if scaled up and applied more widely. Practical experience has informed instrument design and helped to improve predictability, environmental effectiveness, economic efficiency, and equity.  Scaling up and enhancing the use of regulatory instruments, consistent with national circumstances, can improve mitigation outcomes in sectoral applications, and regulatory instruments that include flexibility mechanisms can reduce costs of cutting emissions.  Where implemented, carbon pricing instruments have incentivized low-cost emissions reduction measures, but have been less effective, on their own and at prevailing prices during the assessment period, to promote higher-cost measures necessary for further reductions. Revenue from carbon taxes or emissions trading can be used for equity and distributional goals, for example to support low-income households, among other approaches. There is no consistent evidence that current emission trading systems have led to significant emissions leakage.  Removing fossil fuel subsidies would reduce emissions, improve public revenue and macroeconomic performance, and yield other environmental and sustainable development benefits such as improved public revenue, macroeconomic and sustainability performance; subsidy removal can have adverse distributional impacts especially on the most economically vulnerable groups which, in some cases, can be mitigated by measures such as re-distributing revenue saved, and depend on national circumstances. Fossil fuel subsidy removal is projected by various studies to reduce global CO 2 emissions by 1–4%, and GHG emissions by up to 10% by 2030, varying across regions .  National policies to support technology development, and participation in international markets for emission reduction, can bring positive spillover effects for other countries , although reduced demand for fossil fuels as a result of climate policy could result in costs to exporting countries . Economy-wide packages can meet short-term economic goals while reducing emissions and shifting development pathways towards sustainability. Examples are public spending commitments; pricing reforms; and investment in education and training, R&D and infrastructure. Effective policy packages would be comprehensive in coverage, harnessed to a clear vision for change, balanced across objectives, aligned with specific technology and system needs, consistent in terms of design and tailored to national circumstances .<end_of_turn>

Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Technological Innovation
Text: Technology Innovation, Adoption, Diffusion and  Transfer Enhancing technology innovation systems can provide opportunities to lower emissions growth and create social and environmental co-benefits. Policy packages tailored to national contexts and technological characteristics have been effective in supporting low-emission innovation and technology diffusion. Support for successful low-carbon technological innovation includes public policies such as training and R&D, complemented by regulatory and market-based instruments that create incentives and market opportunities such as appliance performance standards and building codes.  International cooperation on innovation systems and technology development and transfer, accompanied by capacity building, knowledge sharing, and technical and financial support can accelerate the global diffusion of mitigation technologies, practices and policies and align these with other development objectives. Choice architecture can help end-users adopt technology and low-GHG-intensive options. Adoption of low-emission technologies lags in most developing countries, particularly least developed ones, due in part to weaker enabling conditions, including limited finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity building.  International cooperation on innovation works best when tailored to and beneficial for local value chains, when partners collaborate on an equal footing, and when capacity building is an integral part of the effort.  Technological innovation can have trade-offs that include externalities such as new and greater environmental impacts and social inequalities; rebound effects leading to lower net emission reductions or even emission increases; and overdependence on foreign knowledge and providers. Appropriately designed policies and governance have helped address distributional impacts and rebound effects. For example, digital technologies can promote large increases in energy efficiency through coordination and an economic shift to services. However, societal digitalization can induce greater consumption of goods and energy and increased electronic waste as well as negatively impacting labour markets and worsening inequalities between and within countries. Digitalisation requires appropriate governance and policies in order to enhance mitigation potential. Effective policy packages can help to realise synergies, avoid trade-offs and/or reduce rebound effects: these might include a mix of efficiency targets, performance standards, information provision, carbon pricing, finance and technical assistance .  Technology transfer to expand use of digital technologies for land use monitoring, sustainable land management, and improved agricultural productivity supports reduced emissions from deforestation and land use change while also improving GHG accounting and standardisation .<end_of_turn>

","Sure, here's a summary of the main takeaways from the text with respect to the topic:

* Technological innovation can provide opportunities to lower emissions growth and create social and environmental co-benefits.


* Policy packages tailored to national contexts and technological characteristics have been effective in supporting low-emission innovation and technology diffusion.


* International cooperation on innovation systems and technology development and transfer can accelerate the global diffusion of mitigation technologies, practices and policies.


* Adoption of low-emission technologies lags in most developing countries, particularly least developed ones, due in part to weaker enabling conditions.


* Effective policy packages can help to realise synergies, avoid trade-offs and/or reduce rebound effects.


* Technology transfer to expand use of digital technologies for land use monitoring, sustainable land management, and improved agricultural productivity supports reduced emissions from deforestation and land use change.<eos>","0.9607751090943762","0.9593324064558916","0.9112392975127999","0.9219797025084181","0.9383316288928714","9.025138854980469"

The globally averaged combined land and ocean surface temperature data as calculated by a linear trend show a warming of 0.85 [0.65 to 1.06] °C20 over the period 1880 to 2012, for which multiple independently produced datasets exist.

Text: Natural and anthropogenic radiative forcings  Atmospheric concentrations of GHGs are at levels that are unprecedented in at least 800, years. Concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide have all shown large increases since 1750  . CO2 concentrations are increasing at the fastest observed decadal rate of change for 2002– 2011. After almost one decade of stable CH4 concentrations since the late 1990s, atmospheric measurements have shown renewed increases since 2007. N2O concentrations have steadily increased at a rate of 0.73 ± 0.03 ppb/yr over the last three decades.  The total anthropogenic radiative forcing over 1750–2011 is calculated to be a warming effect of 2.3 [1.1 to 3.3] W/m , and it has increased more rapidly since 1970 than during prior decades. Carbon dioxide is the largest single contributor to radiative forcing over 1750–2011 and its trend since 1970. The total anthropogenic radiative forcing estimate for 2011 is substantially higher than the estimate reported in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report for the year 2005. This is caused by a combination of continued growth in most GHG concentrations and an improved estimate of radiative forcing from aerosols.  The radiative forcing from aerosols, which includes cloud adjustments, is better understood and indicates a weaker cooling effect than in AR4. The aerosol radiative forcing over 1750–2011 is estimated as –0.9 [–1.9 to −0.1] W/m . Radiative forcing from aerosols has two competing components: a dominant cooling effect from most aerosols and their cloud adjustments and a partially offsetting warming contribution from black carbon absorption of solar radiation. There is high confidence that the global mean total aerosol radiative forcing has counteracted a substantial portion of radiative forcing from wellmixed GHGs. Aerosols continue to contribute the largest uncertainty to the total radiative forcing estimate.  Changes in solar irradiance and volcanic aerosols cause natural radiative forcing. The radiative forcing from stratospheric volcanic aerosols can have a large cooling effect on the climate system for some years after major volcanic eruptions. Changes in total solar irradiance are calculated to have contributed only around 2% of the total radiative forcing in 2011, relative to 1750. Human activities affecting emission drivers  About half of the cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions between 1750 and 2011 have occurred in the last 40 years . Cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions of 2040 ± 310 GtCO2 were added to the atmosphere between 1750 and 2011. Since 1970, cumulative CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion, cement production and flaring have tripled, and cumulative CO2 emissions from forestry and other land use22 have increased by about 40% 23. In 2011, annual CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion, cement production and flaring were 34.8 ± 2.9 GtCO2/yr. For 2002–2011, average annual emissions from FOLU were 3.3 ± 2.9 GtCO2/yr.  About 40% of these anthropogenic CO2 emissions have remained in the atmosphere since 1750. The rest was removed from the atmosphere by sinks, and stored in natural carbon cycle reservoirs. Sinks from ocean uptake and vegetation with soils account, in roughly equal measures, for the remainder of the cumulative CO2 emissions. The ocean has absorbed about 30% of the emitted anthropogenic CO2, causing ocean acidification.  Total annual anthropogenic GHG emissions have continued to increase over 1970 to 2010 with larger absolute increases between 2000 and 2010. Despite a growing number of climate change mitigation policies, annual GHG emissions grew on average by 1.0 GtCO2-eq per year, from 2000 to 2010, compared to 0.4 GtCO2-eq per year, from 1970 to 2000 24. Total anthropogenic GHG emissions from 2000 to 2010 were the highest in human history and reached 49 GtCO2-eq/yr in 2010. The global economic crisis of 2007/2008 reduced emissions only temporarily.  CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes contributed about 78% to the total GHG emission increase between 1970 and 2010, with a contribution of similar percentage over the 2000–2010 period. Fossil-fuel-related CO2 emissions reached 32 GtCO2/yr, in 2010, and grew further by about 3% between 2010 and 2011, and by about 1 to 2% between 2011 and 2012. CO2 remains the major anthropogenic GHG, accounting for 76% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2010. Of the total, 16% comes from CH4, 6.2% from N2O, and 2.0% from fluorinated gases 25. Annually, since 1970, about 25% of anthropogenic GHG emissions have been in the form of non-CO2 gases.  Total annual anthropogenic GHG emissions have increased by about 10 GtCO2-eq between 2000 and 2010. This increase directly came from the energy, industry, transport and building sectors. Accounting for indirect emissions raises the contributions by the building and industry sectors. Since 2000, GHG emissions have been growing in all sectors, except in agriculture, forestry and other land use 22. In 2010, 35% of GHG emissions were released by the energy sector, 24% from AFOLU, 21% by industry, 14% by transport and 6.4% by the building sector. When emissions from electricity and heat production are attributed to the sectors that use the final energy, the shares of the industry and building sectors in global GHG emissions are increased to 31% and 19%, respectively.  See also Box 3.2 for contributions from various sectors, based on metrics other than 100-year Global Warming Potential. Globally, economic and population growth continue to be the most important drivers of increases in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. The contribution of population growth between 2000 and 2010 remained roughly identical to that of the previous three decades, while the contribution of economic growth has risen sharply. Between 2000 and 2010, both drivers outpaced emission reductions from improvements in energy intensity of gross domestic product. Increased use of coal relative to other energy sources has reversed the long-standing trend in gradual decarbonization  of the world’s energy supply.

The text highlights the following key points:

1. Anthropogenic GHG emissions have led to a total radiative forcing of 2.3 [1.1 to 3.3] W/m2, with carbon dioxide being the largest contributor.
2. The radiative forcing from aerosols, which have both cooling and warming effects, is now better understood and estimated to be –0.9 [–1.9 to −0.1] W/m2.
3. Natural radiative forcings from changes in solar irradiance and volcanic aerosols also contribute to the climate system.
4. About half of the cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions between 1750 and 2011 have occurred in the last 40 years, with fossil fuel combustion, cement production, and flaring being the largest contributors.
5. The ocean has absorbed about 30% of the emitted anthropogenic CO2, causing ocean acidification.
6. Total annual anthropogenic GHG emissions have continued to increase, with the energy, industry, transport, and building sectors being the largest contributors.
7. Economic and population growth are the primary drivers of increases in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion.

Text: Attribution of climate  changes and impacts The evidence for human influence on the climate system has grown since AR4. Human influence has been detected in warming of the atmosphere and the ocean, in changes in the global water cycle, in reductions in snow and ice, and in global mean sea level rise; and it is extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid20th century. In recent decades, changes in climate have caused impacts on natural and human systems on all continents and across the oceans. Impacts are due to observed climate change, irrespective of its cause, indicating the sensitivity of natural and human systems to changing climate. The causes of observed changes in the climate system, as well as in any natural or human system impacted by climate, are established following a consistent set of methods. Detection addresses the question of whether climate or a natural or human system affected by climate has actually changed in a statistical sense, while attribution evaluates the relative contributions of multiple causal factors to an observed change or event with an assignment of statistical confidence. Attribution of climate change to causes quantifies the links between observed climate change and human activity, as well as other, natural, climate drivers. In contrast, attribution of observed impacts to climate change considers the links between observed changes in natural or human systems and observed climate change, regardless of its cause. Results from studies attributing climate change to causes provide estimates of the magnitude of warming in response to changes in radiative forcing and hence support projections of future climate change.

Text: Observed impacts attributed to climate change  In recent decades, changes in climate have caused impacts on natural and human systems on all continents and across the oceans. Impacts are due to observed climate change, irrespective of its cause, indicating the sensitivity of natural and human systems to changing climate. Evidence of observed climate change impacts is strongest and most comprehensive for natural systems. Some impacts on human systems have also been attributed to climate change, with a major or minor contribution of climate change distinguishable from other influences. Impacts on human systems are often geographically heterogeneous because they depend not only on changes in climate variables but also on social and economic factors. Hence, the changes are more easily observed at local levels, while attribution can remain difficult.  In many regions, changing precipitation or melting snow and ice are altering hydrological systems, affecting water resources in terms of quantity and quality. Glaciers continue to shrink almost worldwide due to climate change , affecting runoff and water resources downstream . Climate change is causing permafrost warming and thawing in high-latitude regions and in high-elevation regions .  Many terrestrial, freshwater and marine species have shifted their geographic ranges, seasonal activities, migration patterns, abundances and species interactions in response to ongoing climate change. While only a few recent species extinctions have been attributed as yet to climate change , natural global climate change at rates slower than current anthropogenic climate change caused significant ecosystem shifts and species extinctions during the past millions of years. Increased tree mortality, observed in many places worldwide, has been attributed to climate change in some regions. Increases in the frequency or intensity of ecosystem disturbances such as droughts, windstorms, fires and pest outbreaks have been detected in many parts of the world and in some cases are attributed to climate change . Numerous observations over the last decades in all ocean basins show changes in abundance, distribution shifts poleward and/ or to deeper, cooler waters for marine fishes, invertebrates and phytoplankton, and altered ecosystem composition , tracking climate trends. Some warm-water corals and their reefs have responded to warming with species replacement, bleaching, and decreased coral cover causing habitat loss . Some impacts of ocean acidification on marine organisms have been attributed to human influence, from the thinning of pteropod and foraminiferan shells to the declining growth rates of corals. Oxygen minimum zones are progressively expanding in the tropical Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans, due to reduced ventilation and O2 solubility in warmer, more stratified oceans, and are constraining fish habitat.  Assessment of many studies covering a wide range of regions and crops shows that negative impacts of climate change on crop yields have been more common than positive impacts . The smaller number of studies showing positive impacts relate mainly to high-latitude regions, though it is not yet clear whether the balance of impacts has been negative or positive in these regions. Climate change has negatively affected wheat and maize yields for many regions and in the global aggregate. Effects on rice and soybean yield have been smaller in major production regions and globally, with a median change of zero across all available data which are fewer for soy compared to the other crops. Observed impacts relate mainly to production aspects of food security rather than access or other components of food security. Since AR4, several periods of rapid food and cereal price increases following climate extremes in key producing regions indicate a sensitivity of current markets to climate extremes among other factors .  At present the worldwide burden of human ill-health from climate change is relatively small compared with effects of other stressors and is not well quantified. However, there has been increased heat-related mortality and decreased cold-related mortality in some regions as a result of warming. Local changes in temperature and rainfall have altered the distribution of some water-borne illnesses and disease vectors.  ‘Cascading’ impacts of climate change can now be attributed along chains of evidence from physical climate through to intermediate systems and then to people. The changes in climate feeding into the cascade, in some cases, are linked to human drivers , while, in other cases, assessments of the causes of observed climate change leading into the cascade are not available. In all cases, confidence in detection and attribution to observed climate change decreases for effects further down each impact chain.

The impacts on natural systems, such as changes in precipitation, melting snow and ice, shifting species ranges, and ocean acidification, are more easily observed than those on human systems.

Text: Extreme events  Changes in many extreme weather and climate events have been observed since about 1950. Some of these changes have been linked to human influences, including a decrease in cold temperature extremes, an increase in warm temperature extremes, an increase in extreme high sea levels and an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events in a number of regions. It is very likely that the number of cold days and nights has decreased and the number of warm days and nights has increased on the global scale. It is likely that the frequency of heat waves has increased in large parts of Europe, Asia and Australia. It is very likely that human influence has contributed to the observed global scale changes in the frequency and intensity of daily temperature extremes since the mid-20th century. It is likely that human influence has more than doubled the probability of occurrence of heat waves in some locations.  There is medium confidence that the observed warming has increased heat-related human mortality and decreased coldrelated human mortality in some regions. Extreme heat events currently result in increases in mortality and morbidity in North America , and in Europe with impacts that vary according to people’s age, location and socio-economic factors.  There are likely more land regions where the number of heavy precipitation events has increased than where it has decreased. The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events has likely increased in North America and Europe. In other continents, confidence in trends is at most medium. It is very likely that global near-surface and tropospheric air specific humidity has increased since the 1970s. In land regions where observational coverage is sufficient for assessment, there is medium confidence that anthropogenic forcing has contributed to a global-scale intensification of heavy precipitation over the second half of the 20th century.  There is low confidence that anthropogenic climate change has affected the frequency and magnitude of fluvial floods on a global scale. The strength of the evidence is limited mainly by a lack of long-term records from unmanaged catchments. Moreover, floods are strongly influenced by many human activities impacting catchments, making the attribution of detected changes to climate change difficult. However, recent detection of increasing trends in extreme precipitation and discharges in some catchments implies greater risks of flooding on a regional scale. Costs related to flood damage, worldwide, have been increasing since the 1970s, although this is partly due to the increasing exposure of people and assets.  There is low confidence in observed global-scale trends in droughts, due to lack of direct observations, dependencies of inferred trends on the choice of the definition for drought, and due to geographical inconsistencies in drought trends. There is also low confidence in the attribution of changes in drought over global land areas since the mid-20th century, due to the same observational uncertainties and difficulties in distinguishing decadal scale variability in drought from long-term trends.  There is low confidence that long-term changes in tropical cyclone activity are robust, and there is low confidence in the attribution of global changes to any particular cause. However, it is virtually certain that intense tropical cyclone activity has increased in the North Atlantic since 1970.  It is likely that extreme sea levels  have increased since 1970, being mainly the result of mean sea level rise. Due to a shortage of studies and the difficulty of distinguishing any such impacts from other modifications to coastal systems, limited evidence is available on the impacts of sea level rise.  Impacts from recent climate-related extremes, such as heat waves, droughts, floods, cyclones and wildfires, reveal significant vulnerability and exposure of some ecosystems and many human systems to current climate variability . Impacts of such climate-related extremes include alteration of ecosystems, disruption of food production and water supply, damage to infrastructure and settlements, human morbidity and mortality and consequences for mental health and human well-being. For countries at all levels of development, these impacts are consistent with a significant lack of preparedness for current climate variability in some sectors.  Direct and insured losses from weather-related disasters have increased substantially in recent decades, both globally and regionally. Increasing exposure of people and economic assets has been the major cause of long-term increases in economic losses from weather- and climate-related disasters.

The most effective mitigation strategies involve an integrated approach that combines measures to reduce energy use and the GHG intensity of end-use sectors, decarbonize energy supply, reduce net emissions, and enhance carbon sinks in land-based sectors.  Key sectoral mitigation options include:  1. Energy supply: Decarbonizing electricity generation is a crucial component of cost-effective mitigation strategies. In most scenarios, decarbonization happens more rapidly in electricity generation than in other sectors. Global CO2 emissions from the energy supply sector are projected to decline significantly in the next decade and reach near-zero levels by 2070. 2. Urban areas: The next two decades present an opportunity for mitigation in urban areas, as a significant portion of the world's urban areas will be developed during this period. 3. Agriculture: Cost-effective mitigation options in agriculture include cropland management, grazing land management, and restoration of organic soils. About a third of mitigation potential in forestry can be achieved at a cost of less than $20/tCO2-eq emission. 4. Forestry: Afforestation, sustainable forest management, and reducing deforestation are the most cost-effective mitigation options in forestry. 5. Behavior, lifestyle, and culture: Changes in consumption patterns, dietary change, and reduction in food wastes can significantly reduce GHG emissions. 6. Industry: Improvements in GHG emission efficiency, material use, recycling, and reuse of materials and products, and overall reductions in product and service demand can help reduce GHG emissions below the baseline level. 7. Waste management: Waste reduction, followed by re-use, recycling, and energy recovery, are important options for mitigation in waste management.  The text also highlights the importance of co-benefits and adverse side effects of mitigation measures. Mitigation measures can positively or negatively influence the achievement of other societal goals, such as human health, food security, biodiversity, energy access, livelihoods, and equitable sustainable development.

Text: Carbon cycle and biogeochemistry  Ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 will continue under all four RCPs through to 2100, with higher uptake for higher concentration pathways. The future evolution of the land carbon uptake is less certain. A majority of models projects a continued land carbon uptake under all RCPs, but some models simulate a land carbon loss due to the combined effect of climate change and land use change.  Based on Earth System Models, there is high confidence that the feedback between climate change and the carbon cycle will amplify global warming. Climate change will partially offset increases in land and ocean carbon sinks caused by rising atmospheric CO2. As a result more of the emitted anthropogenic CO2 will remain in the atmosphere, reinforcing the warming.  Earth System Models project a global increase in ocean acidification for all RCP scenarios by the end of the 21st century, with a slow recovery after mid-century under RCP2.6. The decrease in surface ocean pH is in the range of 0.06 to 0.07  for RCP2.6, 0.14 to 0.15 for RCP4.5, 0.20 to 0.21 for RCP6.0, and 0.30 to 0.32 for RCP8.5 .  It is very likely that the dissolved oxygen content of the ocean will decrease by a few percent during the 21st century in response to surface warming, predominantly in the subsurface mid-latitude oceans. There is no consensus on the future volume of low oxygen waters in the open ocean because of large uncertainties in potential biogeochemical effects and in the evolution of tropical ocean dynamics.

Text: The text discusses the main risks of climate change, focusing on the concepts of exposure and vulnerability. Exposure and vulnerability are influenced by various social, economic, and cultural factors that make quantifying their future trends difficult. These factors include wealth distribution, demographics, access to technology and information, employment patterns, quality of adaptive responses, societal values, governance structures, and institutions.  Differences in vulnerability and exposure arise from non-climatic factors and multidimensional inequalities produced by uneven development processes. Marginalized people, including those who are socially, economically, culturally, politically, institutionally, or otherwise marginalized, are especially vulnerable to climate change and adaptation and mitigation responses.  Climate-related hazards exacerbate other stressors, often with negative outcomes for livelihoods, particularly for people living in poverty. Climate-related hazards affect poor people's lives directly through impacts on livelihoods, reductions in crop yields, or the destruction of homes, and indirectly through increased food prices and food insecurity.  Violent conflict increases vulnerability to climate change by damaging assets that facilitate adaptation, including infrastructure, institutions, natural resources, social capital, and livelihood opportunities.</s>  The text discusses the main risks of climate change, which include:  1. Amplification of existing risks and creation of new risks for natural and human systems. 2. Uneven distribution of risks, with disadvantaged people and communities being more vulnerable. 3. Increasing magnitudes of warming leading to severe, pervasive, and irreversible impacts. 4. Risks resulting from the interaction of climate-related hazards with the vulnerability and exposure of human and natural systems. 5. Key risks, which are particularly relevant for understanding dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system, including severe ill-health and disrupted livelihoods, systemic risks due to extreme weather events, food and water insecurity, and loss of ecosystems and biodiversity. 6.

The key takeaways are:  1. Climate change will continue for centuries even if greenhouse gas emissions are stopped, with some aspects being irreversible on a multi-century to millennial timescale. 2. Surface temperatures will remain elevated for many centuries after net anthropogenic CO2 emissions cease. 3. Ocean acidification and sea level rise will continue for centuries, with the extent depending on future greenhouse gas emissions. 4. There is low confidence in projecting certain climate phenomena beyond 2100, such as the Antarctic ice sheet and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. 5. Sustained global warming greater than a threshold could lead to the near-complete loss of the Greenland ice sheet, causing a sea level rise of up to 7 m. 6. Abrupt and irreversible ice loss from the Antarctic ice sheet is possible, but current evidence and understanding is insufficient to make a quantitative assessment. 7.

Adaptation is essential for reducing the impacts of climate change, but its effectiveness has limits, especially with greater magnitudes and rates of change. Effective adaptation strategies consider vulnerability and exposure, socio-economic processes, sustainable development, and climate change. Adaptation research has evolved from a focus on engineering and technological solutions to include more ecosystem-based, institutional, and social measures.  The text highlights the importance of indigenous, local, and traditional knowledge systems in adapting to climate change and the need to integrate such knowledge into practices. Adaptation planning and implementation require societal values, objectives, and risk perceptions, and can be enhanced through complementary actions across levels of governance.  The text also discusses the challenges of adaptation planning and implementation, including interacting constraints such as limited financial and human resources, uncertainties about projected impacts, and competing values. Transformational adaptation, which includes introducing new technologies or practices, forming new financial structures or systems of governance, and shifting the location of activities, can enhance adaptation and promote sustainable development.  The text emphasizes the importance of building adaptive capacity to effectively select and implement adaptation options and the existence of significant co-benefits, synergies, and trade-offs between mitigation and adaptation and among different adaptation responses.

Text: Future risks and impacts caused  by a changing climate Climate change will amplify existing risks and create new risks for natural and human systems. Risks are unevenly distributed and are generally greater for disadvantaged people and communities in countries at all levels of development. Increasing magnitudes of warming increase the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people, species and ecosystems. Continued high emissions would lead to mostly negative impacts for biodiversity, ecosystem services and economic development and amplify risks for livelihoods and for food and human security. Risk of climate-related impacts results from the interaction of climate-related hazards with the vulnerability and exposure of human and natural systems, including their ability to adapt. Rising rates and magnitudes of warming and other changes in the climate system, accompanied by ocean acidification, increase the risk of severe, pervasive, and in some cases, irreversible detrimental impacts. Future climate change will amplify existing climate-related risks and create new risks.  Key risks are potentially severe impacts relevant to understanding dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Risks are considered key due to high hazard or high vulnerability of societies and systems exposed, or both. Their identification is based on large magnitude or high probability of impacts; irreversibility or timing of impacts; persistent vulnerability or exposure; or limited potential to reduce risks. Some risks are particularly relevant for individual regions, while others are global. For risk assessment it is important to evaluate the widest possible range of impacts, including low-probability outcomes with large consequences. Risk levels often increase with temperature and are sometimes more directly linked to other dimensions of climate change, such as the rate of warming, as well as the magnitudes and rates of ocean acidification and sea level rise .  Key risks that span sectors and regions include the following : 1. Risk of severe ill-health and disrupted livelihoods resulting from storm surges, sea level rise and coastal flooding; inland flooding in some urban regions; and periods of extreme heat. 2. Systemic risks due to extreme weather events leading to breakdown of infrastructure networks and critical services. 3. Risk of food and water insecurity and loss of rural livelihoods and income, particularly for poorer populations. 4. Risk of loss of ecosystems, biodiversity and ecosystem goods, functions and services. The overall risks of future climate change impacts can be reduced by limiting the rate and magnitude of climate change, including ocean acidification. Some risks are considerable even at 1°C global mean temperature increase above pre-industrial levels. Many global risks are high to very high for global temperature increases of 4°C or more. These risks include severe and widespread impacts on unique and threatened systems, the extinction of many species, large risks to food security and compromised normal human activities, including growing food or working outdoors in some areas for parts of the year, due to the combination of high temperature and humidity. The precise levels of climate change sufficient to trigger abrupt and irreversible change remain uncertain, but the risk associated with crossing such thresholds in the earth system or in interlinked human and natural systems increases with rising temperature.  Adaptation can substantially reduce the risks of climate change impacts, but greater rates and magnitude of climate change increase the likelihood of exceeding adaptation limits . The potential for adaptation, as well as constraints and limits to adaptation, varies among sectors, regions, communities and ecosystems. The scope for adaptation changes over time and is closely linked to socio-economic development pathways and circumstances. See Figure 2.4 and Table 2.3, along with Topics 3 and 4. Climate change beyond 2100,  irreversibility and abrupt changes Many aspects of climate change and its associated impacts will continue for centuries, even if anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are stopped. The risks of abrupt or irreversible changes increase as the magnitude of the warming increases. Warming will continue beyond 2100 under all RCP scenarios except RCP2.6. Surface temperatures will remain approximately constant at elevated levels for many centuries after a complete cessation of net anthropogenic CO2 emissions . A large fraction of anthropogenic climate change resulting from CO2 emissions is irreversible on a multi-century to millennial timescale, except in the case of a large net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere over a sustained period.  Stabilization of global average surface temperature does not imply stabilization for all aspects of the climate system. Shifting biomes, re-equilibrating soil carbon, ice sheets, ocean temperatures and associated sea level rise all have their own intrinsic long timescales that will result in ongoing changes for hundreds to thousands of years after global surface temperature has been stabilized.  Ocean acidification will continue for centuries if CO2 emissions continue, it will strongly affect marine ecosystems , and the impact will be exacerbated by rising temperature extremes.  Global mean sea level rise will continue for many centuries beyond 2100. The few available analyses that go beyond 2100 indicate sea level rise to be less than 1 m above the pre-industrial level by 2300 for GHG concentrations that peak and decline and remain below 500 ppm CO2-eq, as in scenario RCP2.6. For a radiative forcing that corresponds to a CO2-eq concentration in 2100 that is above 700 ppm but below 1500 ppm, as in scenario RCP8.5, the projected rise is 1 m to more than 3 m by 2300 . There is low confidence in the available models’ ability to project solid ice discharge from the Antarctic ice sheet. Hence, these models likely underestimate the Antarctica ice sheet contribution, resulting in an underestimation of projected sea level rise beyond 2100.  There is little evidence in global climate models of a tipping point or critical threshold in the transition from a perennially ice-covered to a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean, beyond which further sea-ice loss is unstoppable and irreversible.  There is low confidence in assessing the evolution of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation beyond the 21st century because of the limited number of analyses and equivocal results. However, a collapse beyond the 21st century for large sustained warming cannot be excluded.  Sustained mass loss by ice sheets would cause larger sea level rise, and part of the mass loss might be irreversible. There is high confidence that sustained global mean warming greater than a threshold would lead to the near-complete loss of the Greenland ice sheet over a millennium or more, causing a sea level rise of up to 7 m. Current estimates indicate that the threshold is greater than about 1°C but less than about 4°C of global warming with respect to pre-industrial temperatures. Abrupt and irreversible ice loss from a potential instability of marine-based sectors of the Antarctic ice sheet in response to climate forcing is possible, but current evidence and understanding is insufficient to make a quantitative assessment.  Within the 21st century, magnitudes and rates of climate change associated with medium to high emission scenarios  pose a high risk of abrupt and irreversible regional-scale change in the composition, structure and function of marine, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, including wetlands, as well as warm water coral reefs . Examples that could substantially amplify climate change are the boreal-tundra Arctic system and the Amazon forest.  A reduction in permafrost extent is virtually certain with continued rise in global temperatures. Current permafrost areas are projected to become a net emitter of carbon with a loss of 180 to 920 GtCO2 under RCP8.5 over the 21st century . [/INST]","The text discusses the risks and impacts of climate change on both natural and human systems, emphasizing that risks are unevenly distributed and greater for disadvantaged communities. The text highlights that continued high emissions will lead to mostly negative impacts for biodiversity, ecosystem services, and economic development. Key risks include severe ill-health and disrupted livelihoods due to storm surges, sea level rise, coastal flooding, inland flooding, extreme weather events, food and water insecurity, and loss of ecosystems and biodiversity. The risks of climate change impacts can be reduced by limiting the rate and magnitude of climate change, but some risks are considerable even at 1°C global mean temperature increase above pre-industrial levels. The text also discusses the risks of climate change beyond 2100, including irreversibility and abrupt changes, and the importance of adaptation. Some risks, such as ocean acidification and sea level rise, will continue for centuries even if anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are stopped.

Text: The text discusses the risks of climate change on food security, focusing on ecosystems and their services in the oceans, on land, and in freshwater. The main takeaways are:  1. Climate change poses significant risks to ecosystems and human systems, with high extinction risk for many plant and animal species, especially coral reefs and polar ecosystems. 2. Extinctions will be driven by several climate-associated drivers and interactions with other stressors, such as habitat modification, over-exploitation, pollution, eutrophication, and invasive species. 3. Marine ecosystems, especially coral reefs and polar ecosystems, are at risk from ocean acidification, which has impacts on the physiology, behavior, and population dynamics of organisms. 4. Carbon stored in the terrestrial biosphere is susceptible to loss to the atmosphere due to climate change, deforestation, and ecosystem degradation. 5. Coastal systems and low-lying areas will increasingly experience submergence, flooding, and erosion due to sea level rise, posing risks for human populations and assets. 6. Climate change adds to the threats of over-fishing and other non-climatic stressors, challenging the sustained provision of fisheries productivity and other ecosystem services. 7. The geographical range of marine species will shift, causing species richness and fisheries catch potential to increase at mid and high latitudes and decrease at tropical latitudes and in semi-enclosed seas. 8. Ocean acidification acts together with other global changes and local changes, leading to interactive, complex, and amplified impacts for species and ecosystems. 9. Increased tree mortality and associated forest dieback is projected to occur in many regions over the 21st century, posing risks for carbon storage, biodiversity, wood production, water quality, amenity, and economic activity. 10. There is a high risk of substantial carbon and methane emissions as a result of permafrost thawing. 11. Climatic and non-climatic drivers affecting coral reefs will erode habitats, increase coastline exposure to waves and storms, and degrade environmental features important to fisheries and tourism. 12. Some low-lying developing countries and small island states are expected to face very high impacts that could have associated damage and adaptation costs of several percentage points of gross domestic product.</s>  The text discusses the impact of climate change on water resources, food security, human health, and livelihoods. The following are the main takeaways:  1. Climate change will increase water scarcity and flood risks, reducing renewable water resources in dry regions and increasing competition for water among sectors. 2. Food security is at risk due to climate change, with negative impacts on production in tropical and temperate regions, especially for wheat, rice, and maize. 3. Climate change will have significant health impacts, including increased risks from heat waves, foodborne and waterborne diseases, and undernutrition. 4. Urban areas will experience increased risks from heat stress, storms, extreme precipitation, inland and coastal flooding, landslides, air pollution, drought, water scarcity, sea level rise, and storm surges. 5. Rural areas will experience major impacts on water availability, food security, infrastructure, and agricultural incomes, disproportionately affecting the poor. 6. Economic losses from climate change are currently difficult to estimate, but are projected to increase with temperature. 7. Climate change is projected to exacerbate poverty, particularly in developing countries, and create new poverty pockets. 8. Climate change will increase displacement of people, particularly those lacking resources for planned migration and those experiencing extreme weather events. 9. Climate change can indirectly increase risks of violent conflict by amplifying well-documented drivers of conflict, such as poverty and economic shocks.</s>  [/INST]","The text highlights the risks of climate change on food security and the impact on various ecosystems, including oceans, land, and freshwater.

Text: Water, food and urban systems, human  health, security and livelihoods The fractions of the global population that will experience water scarcity and be affected by major river floods are projected to increase with the level of warming in the 21st century .  Climate change over the 21st century is projected to reduce renewable surface water and groundwater resources in most dry subtropical regions, intensifying competition for water among sectors . In presently dry regions, the frequency of droughts will likely increase by the end of the 21st century under RCP8.5. In contrast, water resources are projected to increase at high latitudes. The interaction of increased temperature; increased sediment, nutrient and pollutant loadings from heavy rainfall; increased concentrations of pollutants during droughts; and disruption of treatment facilities during floods will reduce raw water quality and pose risks to drinking water quality.  All aspects of food security are potentially affected by climate change, including food production, access, use and price stability. For wheat, rice and maize in tropical and temperate regions, climate change without adaptation is projected to negatively impact production at local temperature increases of 2°C or more above late 20th century levels, although individual locations may benefit. Projected impacts vary across crops and regions and adaptation scenarios, with about 10% of projections for the 2030–2049 period showing yield gains of more than 10%, and about 10% of projections showing yield losses of more than 25%, compared with the late 20th century. Global temperature increases of ~4°C or more above late 20th century levels, combined with increasing food demand, would pose large risks to food security, both globally and regionally. The relationship between global and regional warming is explained in 2.2.1.  Until mid-century, projected climate change will impact human health mainly by exacerbating health problems that already exist. Throughout the 21st century, climate change is expected to lead to increases in ill-health in many regions and especially in developing countries with low income, as compared to a baseline without climate change . Health impacts include greater likelihood of injury and death due to more intense heat waves and fires, increased risks from foodborne and waterborne diseases and loss of work capacity and reduced labour productivity in vulnerable populations . Risks of undernutrition in poor regions will increase . Risks from vector-borne diseases are projected to generally increase with warming, due to the extension of the infection area and season, despite reductions in some areas that become too hot for disease vectors. Globally, the magnitude and severity of negative impacts will increasingly outweigh positive impacts . By 2100 for RCP8.5, the combination of high temperature and humidity in some areas for parts of the year is expected to compromise common human activities, including growing food and working outdoors.  In urban areas, climate change is projected to increase risks for people, assets, economies and ecosystems, including risks from heat stress, storms and extreme precipitation, inland and coastal flooding, landslides, air pollution, drought, water scarcity, sea level rise and storm surges. These risks will be amplified for those lacking essential infrastructure and services or living in exposed areas.  Rural areas are expected to experience major impacts on water availability and supply, food security, infrastructure and agricultural incomes, including shifts in the production areas of food and non-food crops around the world . These impacts will disproportionately affect the welfare of the poor in rural areas, such as female-headed households and those with limited access to land, modern agricultural inputs, infrastructure and education.  Aggregate economic losses accelerate with increasing temperature, but global economic impacts from climate change are currently difficult to estimate. With recognized limitations, the existing incomplete estimates of global annual economic losses for warming of ~2.5°C above pre-industrial levels are 0.2 to 2.0% of income . Changes in population, age structure, income, technology, relative prices, lifestyle, regulation and governance are projected to have relatively larger impacts than climate change, for most economic sectors. More severe and/or frequent weather hazards are projected to increase disaster-related losses and loss variability, posing challenges for affordable insurance, particularly in developing countries. International dimensions such as trade and relations among states are also important for understanding the risks of climate change at regional scales.  From a poverty perspective, climate change impacts are projected to slow down economic growth, make poverty reduction more difficult, further erode food security and prolong existing poverty traps and create new ones, the latter particularly in urban areas and emerging hotspots of hunger . Climate change impacts are expected to exacerbate poverty in most developing countries and create new poverty pockets in countries with increasing inequality, in both developed and developing countries .  Climate change is projected to increase displacement of people . Displacement risk increases when populations that lack the resources for planned migration experience higher exposure to extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts. Expanding opportunities for mobility can reduce vulnerability for such populations. Changes in migration patterns can be responses to both extreme weather events and longer term climate variability and change, and migration can also be an effective adaptation strategy.  Climate change can indirectly increase risks of violent conflict by amplifying well-documented drivers of these conflicts, such as poverty and economic shocks. Multiple lines of evidence relate climate variability to some forms of conflict.

Text: Climate change beyond 2100,  irreversibility and abrupt changes Many aspects of climate change and its associated impacts will continue for centuries, even if anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are stopped. The risks of abrupt or irreversible changes increase as the magnitude of the warming increases. Warming will continue beyond 2100 under all RCP scenarios except RCP2.6. Surface temperatures will remain approximately constant at elevated levels for many centuries after a complete cessation of net anthropogenic CO2 emissions . A large fraction of anthropogenic climate change resulting from CO2 emissions is irreversible on a multi-century to millennial timescale, except in the case of a large net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere over a sustained period.  Stabilization of global average surface temperature does not imply stabilization for all aspects of the climate system. Shifting biomes, re-equilibrating soil carbon, ice sheets, ocean temperatures and associated sea level rise all have their own intrinsic long timescales that will result in ongoing changes for hundreds to thousands of years after global surface temperature has been stabilized.  Ocean acidification will continue for centuries if CO2 emissions continue, it will strongly affect marine ecosystems , and the impact will be exacerbated by rising temperature extremes.  Global mean sea level rise will continue for many centuries beyond 2100. The few available analyses that go beyond 2100 indicate sea level rise to be less than 1 m above the pre-industrial level by 2300 for GHG concentrations that peak and decline and remain below 500 ppm CO2-eq, as in scenario RCP2.6. For a radiative forcing that corresponds to a CO2-eq concentration in 2100 that is above 700 ppm but below 1500 ppm, as in scenario RCP8.5, the projected rise is 1 m to more than 3 m by 2300 . There is low confidence in the available models’ ability to project solid ice discharge from the Antarctic ice sheet. Hence, these models likely underestimate the Antarctica ice sheet contribution, resulting in an underestimation of projected sea level rise beyond 2100.  There is little evidence in global climate models of a tipping point or critical threshold in the transition from a perennially ice-covered to a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean, beyond which further sea-ice loss is unstoppable and irreversible.  There is low confidence in assessing the evolution of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation beyond the 21st century because of the limited number of analyses and equivocal results. However, a collapse beyond the 21st century for large sustained warming cannot be excluded.  Sustained mass loss by ice sheets would cause larger sea level rise, and part of the mass loss might be irreversible. There is high confidence that sustained global mean warming greater than a threshold would lead to the near-complete loss of the Greenland ice sheet over a millennium or more, causing a sea level rise of up to 7 m.

Text: Foundations of decision-making  about climate change Effective decision-making to limit climate change and its effects can be informed by a wide range of analytical approaches for evaluating expected risks and benefits, recognizing the importance of governance, ethical dimensions, equity, value judgments, economic assessments and diverse perceptions and responses to risk and uncertainty. Sustainable development and equity provide a basis for assessing climate policies. Limiting the effects of climate change is necessary to achieve sustainable development and equity, including poverty eradication. Countries’ past and future contributions to the accumulation of GHGs in the atmosphere are different, and countries also face varying challenges and circumstances and have different capacities to address mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation and adaptation raise issues of equity, justice and fairness and are necessary to achieve sustainable development and poverty eradication. Many of those most vulnerable to climate change have contributed and contribute little to GHG emissions. Delaying mitigation shifts burdens from the present to the future, and insufficient adaptation responses to emerging impacts are already eroding the basis for sustainable development. Both adaptation and mitigation can have distributional effects locally, nationally and internationally, depending on who pays and who benefits. The process of decision-making about climate change, and the degree to which it respects the rights and views of all those affected, is also a concern of justice.  Effective mitigation will not be achieved if individual agents advance their own interests independently. Climate change has the characteristics of a collective action problem at the global scale, because most GHGs accumulate over time and mix globally, and emissions by any agent affect other agents. Cooperative responses, including international cooperation, are therefore required to effectively mitigate GHG emissions and address other climate change issues. The effectiveness of adaptation can be enhanced through complementary actions across levels, including international cooperation. The evidence suggests that outcomes seen as equitable can lead to more effective cooperation.  Decision-making about climate change involves valuation and mediation among diverse values and may be aided by the analytic methods of several normative disciplines. Ethics analyses the different values involved and the relations between them. Recent political philosophy has investigated the question of responsibility for the effects of emissions. Economics and decision analysis provide quantitative methods of valuation which can be used for estimating the social cost of carbon, in cost–benefit and costeffectiveness analyses, for optimization in integrated models and elsewhere. Economic methods can reflect ethical principles, and take account of non-marketed goods, equity, behavioural biases, ancillary benefits and costs and the differing values of money to different people. They are, however, subject to well-documented limitations.  Analytical methods of valuation cannot identify a single best balance between mitigation, adaptation and residual climate impacts. Important reasons for this are that climate change involves extremely complex natural and social processes, there is extensive disagreement about the values concerned, and climate change impacts and mitigation approaches have important distributional effects. Nevertheless, information on the consequences of emissions pathways to alternative climate goals and risk levels can be a useful input into decision-making processes. Evaluating responses to climate change involves assessment of the widest possible range of impacts, including low-probability outcomes with large consequences.  Effective decision-making and risk management in the complex environment of climate change may be iterative: strategies can often be adjusted as new information and understanding develops during implementation. However, adaptation and mitigation choices in the near term will affect the risks of climate change throughout the 21st century and beyond, and prospects for climate-resilient pathways for sustainable development depend on what is achieved through mitigation. Opportunities to take advantage of positive synergies between adaptation and mitigation may decrease with time, particularly if mitigation is delayed too long. Decision-making about climate change is influenced by how individuals and organizations perceive risks and uncertainties and take them into account. They sometimes use simplified decision rules, overestimate or underestimate risks and are biased towards the status quo. They differ in their degree of risk aversion and the relative importance placed on near-term versus long-term ramifications of specific actions.

Interaction among mitigation, adaptation  and sustainable development Climate change is a threat to equitable and sustainable development. Adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development are closely related, with potential for synergies and trade-offs. Climate change poses an increasing threat to equitable and sustainable development. Some climate-related impacts on development are already being observed. Climate change is a threat multiplier. It exacerbates other threats to social and natural systems, placing additional burdens particularly on the poor and constraining possible development paths for all. Development along current global pathways can contribute to climate risk and vulnerability, further eroding the basis for sustainable development.  Aligning climate policy with sustainable development requires attention to both adaptation and mitigation. Interaction among adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development occurs both within and across regions and scales, often in the context of multiple stressors. Some options for responding to climate change could impose risks of other environmental and social costs, have adverse distributional effects and draw resources away from other development priorities, including poverty eradication.  Both adaptation and mitigation can bring substantial co-benefits . Examples of actions with co-benefits include improved air quality; enhanced energy security, reduced energy and water consumption in urban areas through greening cities and recycling water; sustainable agriculture and forestry; and protection of ecosystems for carbon storage and other ecosystem services.  Strategies and actions can be pursued now that will move towards climate-resilient pathways for sustainable development, while at the same time helping to improve livelihoods, social and economic well-being and effective environmental management. Prospects for climate-resilient pathways are related fundamentally to what the world accomplishes with climate change mitigation. Since mitigation reduces the rate as well as the magnitude of warming, it also increases the time available for adaptation to a particular level of climate change, potentially by several decades. Delaying mitigation actions may reduce options for climate-resilient pathways in the future.

The process of decision-making about climate change, and the degree to which it respects the rights and views of all those affected, is also a concern of justice.  Effective mitigation will not be achieved if individual agents advance their own interests independently. Climate change has the characteristics of a collective action problem at the global scale, because most GHGs accumulate over time and mix globally, and emissions by any agent affect other agents. Cooperative responses, including international cooperation, are therefore required to effectively mitigate GHG emissions and address other climate change issues. The effectiveness of adaptation can be enhanced through complementary actions across levels, including international cooperation. The evidence suggests that outcomes seen as equitable can lead to more effective cooperation.  Decision-making about climate change involves valuation and mediation among diverse values and may be aided by the analytic methods of several normative disciplines. Ethics analyses the different values involved and the relations between them. Recent political philosophy has investigated the question of responsibility for the effects of emissions. Economics and decision analysis provide quantitative methods of valuation which can be used for estimating the social cost of carbon, in cost–benefit and costeffectiveness analyses, for optimization in integrated models and elsewhere. Economic methods can reflect ethical principles, and take account of non-marketed goods, equity, behavioural biases, ancillary benefits and costs and the differing values of money to different people. They are, however, subject to well-documented limitations.  Analytical methods of valuation cannot identify a single best balance between mitigation, adaptation and residual climate impacts. Important reasons for this are that climate change involves extremely complex natural and social processes, there is extensive disagreement about the values concerned, and climate change impacts and mitigation approaches have important distributional effects. Nevertheless, information on the consequences of emissions pathways to alternative climate goals and risk levels can be a useful input into decision-making processes. Evaluating responses to climate change involves assessment of the widest possible range of impacts, including low-probability outcomes with large consequences.  Effective decision-making and risk management in the complex environment of climate change may be iterative: strategies can often be adjusted as new information and understanding develops during implementation. However, adaptation and mitigation choices in the near term will affect the risks of climate change throughout the 21st century and beyond, and prospects for climate-resilient pathways for sustainable development depend on what is achieved through mitigation. Opportunities to take advantage of positive synergies between adaptation and mitigation may decrease with time, particularly if mitigation is delayed too long. Decision-making about climate change is influenced by how individuals and organizations perceive risks and uncertainties and take them into account. They sometimes use simplified decision rules, overestimate or underestimate risks and are biased towards the status quo. They differ in their degree of risk aversion and the relative importance placed on near-term versus long-term ramifications of specific actions. Formalized analytical methods for decision-making under uncertainty can account accurately for risk, and focus attention on both short- and long-term consequences.

Text: The text emphasizes the importance of both mitigation and adaptation to reduce the risks of climate change. Mitigation involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions to limit warming and its associated impacts, while adaptation involves adjusting to the unavoidable impacts of climate change. The text highlights that without additional mitigation efforts, warming by the end of the 21st century will lead to high to very high risks of severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts. Mitigation has co-benefits and risks, but the risks do not involve the same possibility of severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts as climate change risks. Adaptation has the potential to reduce climate change impacts over the next few decades, while mitigation has relatively little influence on climate outcomes over this timescale. The text also mentions that the potential for adaptation differs across sectors and will be limited by institutional and capacity constraints, increasing the long-term benefits of mitigation. The level of mitigation will influence the rate and magnitude of climate change, and greater rates and magnitudes of climate change increase the likelihood of exceeding adaptation limits. The text also mentions that some risks of climate change, such as risks to unique and threatened systems and risks associated with extreme weather events, are moderate to high at temperatures 1°C to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Substantial cuts in greenhouse gas emissions over the next few decades can substantially reduce risks of climate change by limiting warming in the second half of the 21st century and beyond. The text also mentions that mitigation involves some level of co-benefits and risks, but these risks do not involve the same possibility of severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts as risks from climate change. The text also mentions that inertia in the economic and climate systems and the possibility of irreversible impacts from climate change increase the benefits of near-term mitigation efforts. The text also mentions that some risks from residual damages are unavoidable, even with mitigation and adaptation. The text also mentions that scenarios that are likely to limit warming to below 2°C or even 3°C compared with pre-industrial temperatures involve large-scale changes in energy systems and potentially land use over the coming decades, and associated risks include those linked to large-scale deployment of technology options for producing low-carbon energy, the potential for high aggregate economic costs of mitigation, and impacts on vulnerable countries and industries. Other risks and co-benefits are associated with human health, food security, energy security, poverty reduction, biodiversity conservation, water availability, income distribution, efficiency of taxation systems, labour supply and employment, urban sprawl, fossil fuel export revenues, and the economic growth of developing countries. The text also mentions that inertia in the economic and climate systems and the possibility of irreversible impacts from climate change increase the benefits of near-term mitigation efforts. The text also mentions that delays in additional mitigation or constraints on technological options limit the mitigation options and increase the long-term mitigation costs as well as other risks that would be incurred in the medium to long term to hold climate change impacts at a given level. The text also mentions that global mean surface warming is largely determined by cumulative emissions, which are, in turn, linked to emissions over different timescales. Limiting risks across Reasons For Concern would imply a limit for cumulative emissions of CO2. Such a limit would require that global net emissions of CO2 eventually decrease to zero. Reducing risks of climate change through mitigation would involve substantial cuts in GHG emissions over the next few decades. But some risks from residual damages are unavoidable, even with mitigation and adaptation. A subset of relevant climate change risks has been estimated using aggregate economic indicators. Such economic estimates have important limitations and are therefore a useful but insufficient basis for decision-making on long-term mitigation targets.</s>  The text discusses the importance of integrating mitigation and adaptation strategies to achieve climate policy goals while promoting sustainable development. The text highlights the co-benefits and trade-offs of mitigation and adaptation measures in various policy areas, such as energy, water, and urbanization. It emphasizes the need for suitable tools, governance structures, and enhanced capacity to manage the complex interactions between climate change and other societal objectives. The text also highlights the potential for synergies between mitigation and adaptation policies and the importance of an integrated approach to policy-making. Examples of integrated responses in energy, water, and urbanization are provided, along with the need for appropriate tools and governance structures to support these responses.

The text identifies several key risks, including severe health and livelihood impacts from storm surges, sea level rise, coastal flooding, inland flooding, extreme heat, systemic risks from extreme weather events, food and water insecurity, and loss of ecosystems and biodiversity. The risks increase with rising temperatures and are linked to other dimensions of climate change, such as ocean acidification and sea level rise.

The risks of climate change impacts are considerable even at 1°C global mean temperature increase above pre-industrial levels, and many global risks are high to very high for temperature increases of 4°C or more.

Text: The text discusses the relationship between cumulative CO2 emissions and global temperature change, with a focus on limiting warming to 2°C. The key takeaways are:  1. Equilibrium climate sensitivity: The likely range of global warming due to a doubling of CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere is between 1.5°C and 4.5°C, with a small probability of being less than 1°C or greater than 6°C. 2. Cumulative emissions and temperature change: There is a strong, near-linear relationship between net cumulative CO2 emissions and projected global temperature change to the year 2100. Past emissions and observed warming support this relationship. 3. Transient climate response: The global mean peak surface temperature change per trillion tonnes of carbon emitted as CO2 is likely in the range of 0.8°C to 2.5°C. This quantity, called the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions, applies to cumulative emissions up to about 2000 GtC. 4. Irreversibility of warming: Warming caused by CO2 emissions is effectively irreversible over multi-century timescales unless measures are taken to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. 5. Limiting warming to 2°C: To limit total human-induced warming to less than 2°C relative to the period 1861–1880, cumulative CO2 emissions from all anthropogenic sources must remain below about 3650 GtCO2. About 1900 GtCO2 were emitted by 2011, leaving about 1000 GtCO2 to be consistent with this temperature goal. However, estimated total fossil carbon reserves exceed this remaining amount by a factor of 4 to 7.</s>  The text emphasizes the importance of both mitigation and adaptation to reduce the risks of climate change.

The text also mentions that many different combinations of technological, behavioral, and policy options can be used to reduce emissions and limit temperature change. About 900 mitigation scenarios were collected for this assessment, each describing different technological, socio-economic, and institutional changes.

Text: Characteristics of adaptation pathways  Adaptation can reduce the risks of climate change impacts, but there are limits to its effectiveness, especially with greater magnitudes and rates of climate change. Taking a longer-term perspective, in the context of sustainable development, increases the likelihood that more immediate adaptation actions will also enhance future options and preparedness. Adaptation can contribute to the well-being of current and future populations, the security of assets and the maintenance of ecosystem goods, functions and services now and in the future. Adaptation is place- and context-specific, with no single approach for reducing risks appropriate across all settings . Effective risk reduction and adaptation strategies consider vulnerability and exposure and their linkages with socio-economic processes, sustainable development, and climate change. Adaptation research since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report has evolved from a dominant consideration of engineering and technological adaptation pathways to include more ecosystem-based, institutional and social measures. A previous focus on cost–benefit analysis, optimization and efficiency approaches has broadened with the development of multi-metric evaluations that include risk and uncertainty dimensions integrated within wider policy and ethical frameworks to assess tradeoffs and constraints. The range of specific adaptation measures has also expanded, as have the links to sustainable development. There are many studies on local and sectoral adaptation costs and benefits, but few global analyses and very low confidence in their results.  Adaptation planning and implementation at all levels of governance are contingent on societal values, objectives and risk perceptions. Recognition of diverse interests, circumstances, social-cultural contexts and expectations can benefit decision-making processes. Indigenous, local and traditional knowledge systems and practices, including indigenous peoples’ holistic view of community and environment, are a major resource for adapting to climate change, but these have not been used consistently in existing adaptation efforts. Integrating such forms of knowledge into practices increases the effectiveness of adaptation as do effective decision support, engagement and policy processes.  Adaptation planning and implementation can be enhanced through complementary actions across levels, from individuals to governments. National governments can coordinate adaptation efforts of local and sub-national governments, for example by protecting vulnerable groups, by supporting economic diversification and by providing information, policy and legal frameworks and financial support. Local government and the private sector are increasingly recognized as critical to progress in adaptation, given their roles in scaling up adaptation of communities, households and civil society and in managing risk information and financing.  A first step towards adaptation to future climate change is reducing vulnerability and exposure to present climate variability, but some near-term responses to climate change may also limit future choices. Integration of adaptation into planning, including policy design, and decision-making can promote synergies with development and disaster risk reduction. However, poor planning or implementation, overemphasizing short-term outcomes or failing to sufficiently anticipate consequences can result in maladaptation, increasing the vulnerability or exposure of the target group in the future or the vulnerability of other people, places or sectors. For example, enhanced protection of exposed assets can lock in dependence on further protection measures. Appropriate adaptation options can be better assessed by including co-benefits and mitigation implications.  Numerous interacting constraints can impede adaptation planning and implementation. Common constraints on implementation arise from the following: limited financial and human resources; limited integration or coordination of governance; uncertainties about projected impacts; different perceptions of risks; competing values; absence of key adaptation leaders and advocates; and limited tools to monitor adaptation effectiveness. Other constraints include insufficient research, monitoring and observation and the financial and other resources to maintain them. Underestimating the complexity of adaptation as a social process can create unrealistic expectations about achieving intended adaptation outcomes .  Greater rates and magnitude of climate change increase the likelihood of exceeding adaptation limits. Limits to adaptation occur when adaptive actions to avoid intolerable risks for an actor’s objectives or for the needs of a system are not possible or are not currently available. Value-based judgments of what constitutes an intolerable risk may differ. Limits to adaptation emerge from the interaction among climate change and biophysical and/or socio-economic constraints. Opportunities to take advantage of positive synergies between adaptation and mitigation may decrease with time, particularly if limits to adaptation are exceeded. In some parts of the world, insufficient responses to emerging impacts are already eroding the basis for sustainable development. For most regions and sectors, empirical evidence is not sufficient to quantify magnitudes of climate change that would constitute a future adaptation limit. Furthermore, economic development, technology and cultural norms and values can change over time to enhance or reduce the capacity of systems to avoid limits. As a consequence, some limits are ‘soft’ in that they may be alleviated over time. Other limits are ‘hard’ in that there are no reasonable prospects for avoiding intolerable risks.  Transformations in economic, social, technological and political decisions and actions can enhance adaptation and promote sustainable development. Restricting adaptation responses to incremental changes to existing systems and structures without considering transformational change may increase costs and losses and miss opportunities. For example, enhancing infrastructure to protect other built assets can be expensive and ultimately not defray increasing costs and risks, whereas options such as relocation or using ecosystem services to adapt may provide a range of benefits now and in the future. Transformational adaptation can include introduction of new technologies or practices, formation of new financial structures or systems of governance, adaptation at greater scales or magnitudes and shifts in the location of activities. Planning and implementation of transformational adaptation could reflect strengthened, altered or aligned paradigms and consequently may place new and increased demands on governance structures to reconcile different goals and visions for the future and to address possible equity and ethical implications: transformational adaptation pathways are enhanced by iterative learning, deliberative processes, and innovation. At the national level, transformation is considered most effective when it reflects a country’s own visions and approaches to achieving sustainable development in accordance with its national circumstances and priorities.  Building adaptive capacity is crucial for effective selection and implementation of adaptation options . Successful adaptation requires not only identifying adaptation options and assessing their costs and benefits, but also increasing the adaptive capacity of human and natural systems . This can involve complex governance challenges and new institutions and institutional arrangements.  Significant co-benefits, synergies and trade-offs exist between mitigation and adaptation and among different adaptation responses; interactions occur both within and across regions . Increasing efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change imply an increasing complexity of interactions, particularly at the intersections among water, energy, land use and biodiversity, but tools to understand and manage these interactions remain limited. Examples of actions with co-benefits include improved energy efficiency and cleaner energy sources, leading to reduced emissions of health-damaging, climate-altering air pollutants; reduced energy and water consumption in urban areas through greening cities and recycling water; sustainable agriculture and forestry; and protection of ecosystems for carbon storage and other ecosystem services.

Text: Characteristics of adaptation pathways  Adaptation can reduce the risks of climate change impacts, but there are limits to its effectiveness, especially with greater magnitudes and rates of climate change. Taking a longer-term perspective, in the context of sustainable development, increases the likelihood that more immediate adaptation actions will also enhance future options and preparedness. Adaptation can contribute to the well-being of current and future populations, the security of assets and the maintenance of ecosystem goods, functions and services now and in the future. Adaptation is place- and context-specific, with no single approach for reducing risks appropriate across all settings . Effective risk reduction and adaptation strategies consider vulnerability and exposure and their linkages with socio-economic processes, sustainable development, and climate change. Adaptation research since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report has evolved from a dominant consideration of engineering and technological adaptation pathways to include more ecosystem-based, institutional and social measures. A previous focus on cost–benefit analysis, optimization and efficiency approaches has broadened with the development of multi-metric evaluations that include risk and uncertainty dimensions integrated within wider policy and ethical frameworks to assess tradeoffs and constraints. The range of specific adaptation measures has also expanded, as have the links to sustainable development. There are many studies on local and sectoral adaptation costs and benefits, but few global analyses and very low confidence in their results.  Adaptation planning and implementation at all levels of governance are contingent on societal values, objectives and risk perceptions. Recognition of diverse interests, circumstances, social-cultural contexts and expectations can benefit decision-making processes. Indigenous, local and traditional knowledge systems and practices, including indigenous peoples’ holistic view of community and environment, are a major resource for adapting to climate change, but these have not been used consistently in existing adaptation efforts. Integrating such forms of knowledge into practices increases the effectiveness of adaptation as do effective decision support, engagement and policy processes.  Adaptation planning and implementation can be enhanced through complementary actions across levels, from individuals to governments. National governments can coordinate adaptation efforts of local and sub-national governments, for example by protecting vulnerable groups, by supporting economic diversification and by providing information, policy and legal frameworks and financial support. Local government and the private sector are increasingly recognized as critical to progress in adaptation, given their roles in scaling up adaptation of communities, households and civil society and in managing risk information and financing.  A first step towards adaptation to future climate change is reducing vulnerability and exposure to present climate variability, but some near-term responses to climate change may also limit future choices. Integration of adaptation into planning, including policy design, and decision-making can promote synergies with development and disaster risk reduction. However, poor planning or implementation, overemphasizing short-term outcomes or failing to sufficiently anticipate consequences can result in maladaptation, increasing the vulnerability or exposure of the target group in the future or the vulnerability of other people, places or sectors. For example, enhanced protection of exposed assets can lock in dependence on further protection measures. Appropriate adaptation options can be better assessed by including co-benefits and mitigation implications.  Numerous interacting constraints can impede adaptation planning and implementation. Common constraints on implementation arise from the following: limited financial and human resources; limited integration or coordination of governance; uncertainties about projected impacts; different perceptions of risks; competing values; absence of key adaptation leaders and advocates; and limited tools to monitor adaptation effectiveness. Other constraints include insufficient research, monitoring and observation and the financial and other resources to maintain them. Underestimating the complexity of adaptation as a social process can create unrealistic expectations about achieving intended adaptation outcomes .  Greater rates and magnitude of climate change increase the likelihood of exceeding adaptation limits. Limits to adaptation occur when adaptive actions to avoid intolerable risks for an actor’s objectives or for the needs of a system are not possible or are not currently available. Value-based judgments of what constitutes an intolerable risk may differ. Limits to adaptation emerge from the interaction among climate change and biophysical and/or socio-economic constraints. Opportunities to take advantage of positive synergies between adaptation and mitigation may decrease with time, particularly if limits to adaptation are exceeded. In some parts of the world, insufficient responses to emerging impacts are already eroding the basis for sustainable development. For most regions and sectors, empirical evidence is not sufficient to quantify magnitudes of climate change that would constitute a future adaptation limit. Furthermore, economic development, technology and cultural norms and values can change over time to enhance or reduce the capacity of systems to avoid limits. As a consequence, some limits are ‘soft’ in that they may be alleviated over time. Other limits are ‘hard’ in that there are no reasonable prospects for avoiding intolerable risks.  Transformations in economic, social, technological and political decisions and actions can enhance adaptation and promote sustainable development. Restricting adaptation responses to incremental changes to existing systems and structures without considering transformational change may increase costs and losses and miss opportunities. For example, enhancing infrastructure to protect other built assets can be expensive and ultimately not defray increasing costs and risks, whereas options such as relocation or using ecosystem services to adapt may provide a range of benefits now and in the future. Transformational adaptation can include introduction of new technologies or practices, formation of new financial structures or systems of governance, adaptation at greater scales or magnitudes and shifts in the location of activities. Planning and implementation of transformational adaptation could reflect strengthened, altered or aligned paradigms and consequently may place new and increased demands on governance structures to reconcile different goals and visions for the future and to address possible equity and ethical implications: transformational adaptation pathways are enhanced by iterative learning, deliberative processes, and innovation. At the national level, transformation is considered most effective when it reflects a country’s own visions and approaches to achieving sustainable development in accordance with its national circumstances and priorities.  Building adaptive capacity is crucial for effective selection and implementation of adaptation options . Successful adaptation requires not only identifying adaptation options and assessing their costs and benefits, but also increasing the adaptive capacity of human and natural systems . This can involve complex governance challenges and new institutions and institutional arrangements.  Significant co-benefits, synergies and trade-offs exist between mitigation and adaptation and among different adaptation responses; interactions occur both within and across regions . Increasing efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change imply an increasing complexity of interactions, particularly at the intersections among water, energy, land use and biodiversity, but tools to understand and manage these interactions remain limited. Examples of actions with co-benefits include improved energy efficiency and cleaner energy sources, leading to reduced emissions of health-damaging, climate-altering air pollutants; reduced energy and water consumption in urban areas through greening cities and recycling water; sustainable agriculture and forestry; and protection of ecosystems for carbon storage and other ecosystem services.

Text: The text discusses the characteristics of various mitigation pathways to limit global warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels.

The text highlights the challenges of implementing such reductions, including technological, economic, social, and institutional hurdles.  The text also provides information on the expected global emissions under baseline scenarios, which are between approximately 75 GtCO2-eq/yr and almost 140 GtCO2-eq/yr in 2100. These scenarios result in global mean surface temperature increases ranging from about 3.7°C to 4.8°C above the average for 1850–1900 for a median climate response.

About 900 mitigation scenarios were collected for this assessment, each describing different technological, socio-economic, and institutional changes.  The text also discusses the importance of reducing emissions of non-CO2 climate forcing agents, such as nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases, as part of mitigation strategies.  The text highlights that delaying additional mitigation efforts until 2030 will substantially increase the challenges associated with limiting warming over the 21st century to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels. The text also mentions that the estimated global emission levels by 2020 based on the Cancún Pledges are not consistent with cost-effective long-term mitigation trajectories that are at least as likely as not to limit warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels but do not preclude the option to meet this goal.

The text also highlights the challenges of implementing emissions reductions, including technological, economic, social, and institutional barriers. It notes that limiting warming to lower or higher levels involves similar challenges but on different timescales. The text discusses various mitigation scenarios, including those with temporary overshoot of atmospheric concentrations, which rely on the availability and widespread deployment of bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage and afforestation in the second half of the century.  The text also mentions the importance of reducing emissions of non-CO2 climate forcing agents, such as nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases, as part of mitigation strategies. It notes that all current GHG emissions and other climate forcing agents affect the rate and magnitude of climate change over the next few decades, and that reducing the emissions of certain short-lived climate forcing agents can have a relatively fast impact on climate change and possible co-benefits for air pollution.

Text: The text discusses the characteristics of various mitigation pathways to limit global warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels. These pathways require substantial emissions reductions in the coming decades and near zero emissions of CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases by the end of the century. The text highlights the challenges of implementing such reductions, including technological, economic, social, and institutional hurdles. The text also mentions that without additional efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, global emission growth is expected to persist.  The text provides information on the expected global GHG emissions under baseline scenarios, which range between approximately 75 GtCO2-eq/yr and almost 140 GtCO2-eq/yr in 2100. These emission levels would result in global mean surface temperature increases ranging from about 3.7°C to 4.8°C above the average for 1850–1900 for a median climate response.  The text also mentions that many different combinations of technological, behavioral, and policy options can be used to reduce emissions and limit temperature change. About 900 mitigation scenarios were collected for this assessment, each describing different technological, socio-economic, and institutional changes.  The text provides information on the likelihood of limiting warming to different temperature levels based on CO2-equivalent concentrations in 2100. Scenarios leading to CO2-eq concentrations of about 450 ppm or lower are likely to maintain warming below 2°C over the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels. Mitigation scenarios reaching about 500 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 are more likely than not to limit warming to less than 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels, unless concentration levels temporarily exceed roughly 530 ppm CO2-eq before 2100.  The text also mentions that reducing emissions of non-CO2 climate forcing agents can be an important element of mitigation strategies. Emissions of non-CO2 gases, such as nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases, contributed about 27% to the total emissions of Kyoto gases in 2010. For most non-CO2 gases, near-term, low-cost options are available to reduce their emissions. However, some sources of these non-CO2 gases are difficult to mitigate, such as N2O emissions from fertilizer use and CH4 emissions from livestock.  The text also discusses the importance of reducing emissions of short-lived climate forcing agents, such as black carbon and methane, to reduce the rate of warming in the short term but have only a limited effect on long-term warming, which is driven mainly by CO2 emissions. There are large uncertainties related to the climate impacts of some of the short-lived climate forcing agents.  The text also mentions that delaying additional mitigation to 2030 will substantially increase the challenges associated with limiting warming over the 21st century to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels. GHG emissions in 2030 lie between about 30 GtCO2-eq/yr and 50 GtCO2-eq/yr in cost-effective scenarios that are likely to limit warming to less than 2°C this century relative to pre-industrial levels. Scenarios with GHG emission levels of above 55 GtCO2-eq/yr require substantially higher rates of emissions reductions between 2030 and 2050, a larger reliance on CDR technologies in the long term, and higher transitional and long-term economic impacts.  The text also mentions that the distribution of costs can differ from the distribution of the actions themselves in globally cost-effective scenarios, with the majority of mitigation efforts taking place in countries with the highest future GHG emissions in baseline scenarios. Some studies exploring particular effort-sharing frameworks have estimated substantial global financial flows associated with mitigation in scenarios that are likely to more unlikely than likely to limit warming during the 21st century to less than 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels.</s>  [/INST]","The text discusses the need for substantial emissions reductions to limit global warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels.

Without further emissions reduction efforts, global warming is projected to reach 3.7°C to 4.8°C above the average for 1850–1900. To limit warming to below 2°C, substantial emissions reductions are required over the next few decades and near-zero emissions by the end of the century. However, achieving this poses significant challenges due to technological, economic, social, and institutional factors that increase with delays and the lack of availability of key technologies.

The text also mentions that many different combinations of technological, behavioral, and policy options can be used to reduce emissions and limit temperature change. About 900 mitigation scenarios were collected for this assessment, each describing different technological, socio-economic, and institutional changes. Emission reductions under these scenarios lead to concentrations in 2100 from 430 ppm CO2-eq to above 720 ppm CO2-eq.

Scenarios leading to CO2-eq concentrations of about 450 ppm or lower in 2100 are likely to maintain warming below 2°C over the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels. Scenarios with concentration levels of about 500 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 are more likely than not to limit warming to less than 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels, unless concentration levels temporarily exceed roughly 530 ppm CO2-eq before 2100. In this case, warming is about as likely as not to remain below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels. Scenarios that exceed about 650 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 are unlikely to limit warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels.

Mitigation scenarios in which warming is more likely than not to be less than 1.5°C relative to pre-industrial levels by 2100 are characterized by concentration levels by 2100 of below 430 ppm CO2-eq. These scenarios describe a wide range of changes in land use, reflecting different assumptions about the scale of bioenergy production, afforestation, and reduced deforestation.

Delaying additional mitigation to 2030 will substantially increase the challenges associated with limiting warming over the 21st century to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels.

Reducing the emissions of certain short-lived climate forcing agents can reduce the rate of warming in the short term but will have only a limited effect on long-term warming, which is driven mainly by CO2 emissions. There are large uncertainties related to the climate impacts of some of the short-lived climate forcing agents.

Reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide would cause warming. Near-term reductions in short-lived climate forcing agents can have a relatively fast impact on climate change and possible co-benefits for air pollution.

The text also mentions that without additional efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, global emissions are expected to continue growing.  The text provides a range of global mean surface temperature increases in 2100, from approximately 3.7°C to 4.8°C above the average for 1850–1900 for a median climate response. It also mentions that many different combinations of technological, behavioral, and policy options can be used to reduce emissions and limit temperature change. The text discusses the importance of reducing emissions of non-CO2 climate forcing agents, such as nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases, in mitigation strategies.  The text also mentions that the economic costs of mitigation vary widely depending on methodologies and assumptions. Mitigation scenarios that are likely to limit warming to below 2°C through the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels entail losses in global consumption of 1 to 4% in 2030, 2 to 6% in 2050, and 3% to 11% in 2100, relative to consumption in baseline scenarios. The text also mentions that mitigation costs can increase substantially in the absence or under limited availability of mitigation technologies.  The text also mentions that mitigation efforts and associated costs are expected to vary across countries, and the majority of mitigation efforts take place in countries with the highest future GHG emissions in baseline scenarios.

The text also mentions that without additional efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, global emissions are expected to continue growing.  The text provides a range of global emission levels in 2100, which is approximately between the RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 pathways. Baseline scenarios exceed 450 ppm CO2-eq by 2030 and reach CO2-eq concentration levels between about 750 ppm CO2-eq and more than 1300 ppm CO2-eq by 2100. The text also mentions that many different combinations of technological, behavioral, and policy options can be used to reduce emissions and limit temperature change.  The text suggests that scenarios leading to CO2-eq concentrations of about 450 ppm or lower in 2100 are likely to maintain warming below 2°C over the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels. Scenarios with concentration levels of about 500 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 are more likely than not to limit warming to less than 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels, unless concentration levels temporarily exceed roughly 530 ppm CO2-eq before 2100.

Text: Mitigation  There has been a considerable increase in national and subnational mitigation plans and strategies since AR4. In 2012, 67% of global GHG emissions were subject to national legislation or strategies versus 45% in 2007. However, there has not yet been a substantial deviation in global emissions from the past trend. These plans and strategies are in their early stages of development and implementation in many countries, making it difficult to assess their aggregate impact on future global emissions.  Since AR4, there has been an increased focus on policies designed to integrate multiple objectives, increase co-benefits and reduce adverse side effects. Governments often explicitly reference co-benefits in climate and sectoral plans and strategies.  Sector-specific policies have been more widely used than economy-wide policies . Although most economic theory suggests that economy-wide policies for mitigation would be more cost-effective than sector-specific policies, administrative and political barriers may make economy-wide policies harder to design and implement than sector-specific policies. The latter may be better suited to address barriers or market failures specific to certain sectors and may be bundled in packages of complementary policies  In principle, mechanisms that set a carbon price, including cap and trade systems and carbon taxes, can achieve mitigation in a cost-effective way, but have been implemented with diverse effects due in part to national circumstances as well as policy design. The short-run environmental effects of cap and trade systems have been limited as a result of loose caps or caps that have not proved to be constraining. In some countries, tax-based policies specifically aimed at reducing GHG emissions—alongside technology and other policies—have helped to weaken the link between GHG emissions and gross domestic product . In addition, in a large group of countries, fuel taxes have had effects that are akin to sectoral carbon taxes . Revenues from carbon taxes or auctioned emission allowances are used in some countries to reduce other taxes and/or to provide transfers to low-income groups. This illustrates the general principle that mitigation policies that raise government revenue generally have lower social costs than approaches which do not.  Economic instruments in the form of subsidies may be applied across sectors, and include a variety of policy designs, such as tax rebates or exemptions, grants, loans and credit lines. An increasing number and variety of RE policies including subsidies—motivated by many factors—have driven escalated growth of RE technologies in recent years. Government policies play a crucial role in accelerating the deployment of RE technologies. Energy access and social and economic development have been the primary drivers in most developing countries whereas secure energy supply and environmental concerns have been most important in developed countries. The focus of policies is broadening from a concentration primarily on RE electricity to include RE heating and cooling and transportation.  The reduction of subsidies for GHG-related activities in various sectors can achieve emission reductions, depending on the social and economic context. While subsidies can affect emissions in many sectors, most of the recent literature has focused on subsidies for fossil fuels. Since AR4 a small but growing literature based on economy-wide models has projected that complete removal of subsidies to fossil fuels in all countries could result in reductions in global aggregate emissions by mid-century . Studies vary in methodology, the type and definition of subsidies and the time frame for phase out considered. In particular, the studies assess the impacts of complete removal of all fossil fuel subsides without seeking to assess which subsidies are wasteful and inefficient, keeping in mind national circumstances.  Regulatory approaches and information measures are widely used and are often environmentally effective . Examples of regulatory approaches include energy efficiency standards; examples of information programmes include labelling programmes that can help consumers make better-informed decisions.  Mitigation policy could devalue fossil fuel assets and reduce revenues for fossil fuel exporters, but differences between regions and fuels exist. Most mitigation scenarios are associated with reduced revenues from coal and oil trade for major exporters. The effect on natural gas export revenues is more uncertain. The availability of CCS would reduce the adverse effect of mitigation on the value of fossil fuel assets.  Interactions between or among mitigation policies may be synergistic or may have no additive effect on reducing emissions . For instance, a carbon tax can have an additive environmental effect to policies such as subsidies for the supply of RE. By contrast, if a cap and trade system has a sufficiently stringent cap to affect emission-related decisions, then other policies have no further impact on reducing emissions  . In either case, additional policies may be needed to address market failures relating to innovation and technology diffusion.  Sub-national climate policies are increasingly prevalent, both in countries with national policies and in those without. These policies include state and provincial climate plans combining market, regulatory and information instruments, and sub-national cap-and-trade systems. In addition, transnational cooperation has arisen among sub-national actors, notably among institutional investors, NGOs seeking to govern carbon offset markets, and networks of cities seeking to collaborate in generating low-carbon urban development.  Co-benefits and adverse side effects of mitigation could affect achievement of other objectives such as those related to human health, food security, biodiversity, local environmental quality, energy access, livelihoods and equitable sustainable development:  • Mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 or 500 ppm CO2-equivalent by 2100 show reduced costs for achieving air quality and energy security objectives, with significant co-benefits for human health, ecosystem impacts and sufficiency of resources and resilience of the energy system.  • Some mitigation policies raise the prices for some energy services and could hamper the ability of societies to expand access to modern energy services to underserved populations . These potential adverse side effects can be avoided with the adoption of complementary policies such as income tax rebates or other benefit transfer mechanisms. The costs of achieving nearly universal access to electricity and clean fuels for cooking and heating are projected to be between USD 72 to 95 billion per year until 2030 with minimal effects on GHG emissions and multiple benefits in health and air pollutant reduction.  Whether or not side effects materialize, and to what extent side effects materialize, will be case- and site-specific, and depend on local circumstances and the scale, scope and pace of implementation. Many co-benefits and adverse side effects have not been well-quantified.

Innovation and investments in environmentally sound infrastructure and technologies can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance resilience to climate change . Innovation and change can expand the availability and/ or effectiveness of adaptation and mitigation options. For example, investments in low-carbon and carbon-neutral energy technologies can reduce the energy intensity of economic development, the carbon intensity of energy, GHG emissions, and the long-term costs of mitigation. Similarly, new technologies and infrastructure can increase the resilience of human systems while reducing adverse impacts on natural systems. Investments in technology and infrastructure rely on an enabling policy environment, access to finance and technology and broader economic development that builds capacity .  Adaptation and mitigation are constrained by the inertia of global and regional trends in economic development, GHG emissions, resource consumption, infrastructure and settlement patterns, institutional behaviour and technology . Such inertia may limit the capacity to reduce GHG emissions, remain below particular climate thresholds or avoid adverse impacts. Some constraints may be overcome through new technologies, financial resources, increased institutional effectiveness and governance or changes in social and cultural attitudes and behaviours.  Vulnerability to climate change, GHG emissions, and the capacity for adaptation and mitigation are strongly influenced by livelihoods, lifestyles, behaviour and culture  . Shifts toward more energy-intensive lifestyles can contribute to higher energy and resource consumption, driving greater energy production and GHG emissions and increasing mitigation costs. In contrast, emissions can be substantially lowered through changes in consumption patterns. The social acceptability and/or effectiveness of climate policies are influenced by the extent to which they incentivize or depend on regionally appropriate changes in lifestyles or behaviours. Similarly, livelihoods that depend on climate-sensitive sectors or resources may be particularly vulnerable to climate change and climate change policies. Economic development and urbanization of landscapes exposed to climate hazards may increase the exposure of human settlements and reduce the resilience of natural systems.  For many regions and sectors, enhanced capacities to mitigate and adapt are part of the foundation essential for managing climate change risks. Such capacities are place- and context-specific and therefore there is no single approach for reducing risk that is appropriate across all settings.

Text: Common enabling factors and constraints  for adaptation and mitigation responses Adaptation and mitigation responses are underpinned by common enabling factors. These include effective institutions and governance, innovation and investments in environmentally sound technologies and infrastructure, sustainable livelihoods and behavioural and lifestyle choices. Innovation and investments in environmentally sound infrastructure and technologies can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance resilience to climate change . Innovation and change can expand the availability and/ or effectiveness of adaptation and mitigation options. For example, investments in low-carbon and carbon-neutral energy technologies can reduce the energy intensity of economic development, the carbon intensity of energy, GHG emissions, and the long-term costs of mitigation. Similarly, new technologies and infrastructure can increase the resilience of human systems while reducing adverse impacts on natural systems. Investments in technology and infrastructure rely on an enabling policy environment, access to finance and technology and broader economic development that builds capacity .  Adaptation and mitigation are constrained by the inertia of global and regional trends in economic development, GHG emissions, resource consumption, infrastructure and settlement patterns, institutional behaviour and technology . Such inertia may limit the capacity to reduce GHG emissions, remain below particular climate thresholds or avoid adverse impacts. Some constraints may be overcome through new technologies, financial resources, increased institutional effectiveness and governance or changes in social and cultural attitudes and behaviours.  Vulnerability to climate change, GHG emissions, and the capacity for adaptation and mitigation are strongly influenced by livelihoods, lifestyles, behaviour and culture  . Shifts toward more energy-intensive lifestyles can contribute to higher energy and resource consumption, driving greater energy production and GHG emissions and increasing mitigation costs. In contrast, emissions can be substantially lowered through changes in consumption patterns. The social acceptability and/or effectiveness of climate policies are influenced by the extent to which they incentivize or depend on regionally appropriate changes in lifestyles or behaviours. Similarly, livelihoods that depend on climate-sensitive sectors or resources may be particularly vulnerable to climate change and climate change policies. Economic development and urbanization of landscapes exposed to climate hazards may increase the exposure of human settlements and reduce the resilience of natural systems.  For many regions and sectors, enhanced capacities to mitigate and adapt are part of the foundation essential for managing climate change risks. Such capacities are place- and context-specific and therefore there is no single approach for reducing risk that is appropriate across all settings. For example, developing nations with low income levels have the lowest financial, technological and institutional capacities to pursue low-carbon, climate-resilient development pathways. Although developed nations generally have greater relative capacity to manage the risks of climate change, such capacity does not necessarily translate into the implementation of adaptation and mitigation options.  Improving institutions as well as enhancing coordination and cooperation in governance can help overcome regional constraints associated with mitigation, adaptation and disaster risk reduction. Despite the presence of a wide array of multilateral, national and sub-national institutions focused on adaptation and mitigation, global GHG emissions continue to increase and identified adaptation needs have not been adequately addressed.

Text: Response options for adaptation  Adaptation options exist in all sectors, but their context for implementation and potential to reduce climate-related risks differs across sectors and regions. Some adaptation responses involve significant co-benefits, synergies and trade-offs. Increasing climate change will increase challenges for many adaptation options. People, governments and the private sector are starting to adapt to a changing climate. Since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report , understanding of response options has increased, with improved knowledge of their benefits, costs and links to sustainable development. Adaptation can take a variety of approaches depending on its context in vulnerability reduction, disaster risk management or proactive adaptation planning. These include : • Social, ecological asset and infrastructure development • Technological process optimization • Integrated natural resources management • Institutional, educational and behavioural change or reinforcement • Financial services, including risk transfer • Information systems to support early warning and proactive planning There is increasing recognition of the value of social , institutional, and ecosystem-based measures and of the extent of constraints to adaptation. Effective strategies and actions consider the potential for co-benefits and opportunities within wider strategic goals and development plans.  Opportunities to enable adaptation planning and implementation exist in all sectors and regions, with diverse potential and approaches depending on context. The need for adaptation along with associated challenges is expected to increase with climate change . Examples of key adaptation approaches for particular sectors, including constraints and limits, are summarized below.  Freshwater resources Adaptive water management techniques, including scenario planning, learning-based approaches and flexible and low-regret solutions, can help adjust to uncertain hydrological changes due to climate change and their impacts . Strategies include adopting integrated water management, augmenting supply, reducing the mismatch between water supply and demand, reducing non-climate stressors, strengthening institutional capacities and adopting more water-efficient technologies and water-saving strategies.  Terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems Management actions can reduce but not eliminate risks of impacts to terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems due to climate change. Actions include maintenance of genetic diversity, assisted species migration and dispersal, manipulation of disturbance regimes and reduction of other stressors. Management options that reduce non-climatic stressors, such as habitat modification, overexploitation, pollution and invasive species, increase the inherent capacity of ecosystems and their species to adapt to a changing climate. Other options include improving early warning systems and associated response systems. Enhanced connectivity of vulnerable ecosystems may also assist autonomous adaptation. Translocation of species is controversial and is expected to become less feasible where whole ecosystems are at risk.  Coastal systems and low-lying areas Increasingly, coastal adaptation options include those based on integrated coastal zone management, local community participation, ecosystems-based approaches and disaster risk reduction, mainstreamed into relevant strategies and management plans. The analysis and implementation of coastal adaptation has progressed more significantly in developed countries than in developing countries. The relative costs of coastal adaptation are expected to vary strongly among and within regions and countries.  Marine systems and oceans Marine forecasting and early warning systems as well as reducing non-climatic stressors have the potential to reduce risks for some fisheries and aquaculture industries, but options for unique ecosystems such as coral reefs are limited. Fisheries and some aquaculture industries with high-technology and/or large investments have high capacities for adaptation due to greater development of environmental monitoring, modelling and resource assessments. Adaptation options include large-scale translocation of industrial fishing activities and flexible management that can react to variability and change. For smaller-scale fisheries and nations with limited adaptive capacities, building social resilience, alternative livelihoods and occupational flexibility are important strategies. Adaptation options for coral reef systems are generally limited to reducing other stressors, mainly by enhancing water quality and limiting pressures from tourism and fishing, but their efficacy will be severely reduced as thermal stress and ocean acidification increase.  Food production system/Rural areas Adaptation options for agriculture include technological responses, enhancing smallholder access to credit and other critical production resources, strengthening institutions at local to regional levels and improving market access through trade reform. Responses to decreased food production and quality include: developing new crop varieties adapted to changes in CO2, temperature, and drought; enhancing the capacity for climate risk management; and offsetting economic impacts of land use change. Improving financial support and investing in the production of small-scale farms can also provide benefits. Expanding agricultural markets and improving the predictability and reliability of the world trading system could result in reduced market volatility and help manage food supply shortages caused by climate change.  Urban areas/Key economic sectors and services Urban adaptation benefits from effective multi-level governance, alignment of policies and incentives, strengthened local government and community adaptation capacity, synergies with the private sector and appropriate financing and institutional development. Enhancing the capacity of low-income groups and vulnerable communities and their partnerships with local governments can also be an effective urban climate adaptation strategy. Examples of adaptation mechanisms include large-scale public-private risk reduction initiatives and economic diversification and government insurance for the non-diversifiable portion of risk. In some locations, especially at the upper end of projected climate changes, responses could also require transformational changes such as managed retreat.  Human health, security and livelihoods Adaptation options that focus on strengthening existing delivery systems and institutions, as well as insurance and social protection strategies, can improve health, security and livelihoods in the near term. The most effective vulnerability reduction measures for health in the near term are programmes that implement and improve basic public health measures such as provision of clean water and sanitation, secure essential health care including vaccination and child health services, increase capacity for disaster preparedness and response and alleviate poverty. Options to address heat related mortality include health warning systems linked to response strategies, urban planning and improvements to the built environment to reduce heat stress. Robust institutions can manage many transboundary impacts of climate change to reduce risk of conflicts over shared natural resources. Insurance programmes, social protection measures and disaster risk management may enhance long-term livelihood resilience among the poor and marginalized people, if policies address multi-dimensional poverty.  Significant co-benefits, synergies and trade-offs exist between adaptation and mitigation and among different adaptation responses; interactions occur both within and across regions and sectors. For example, investments in crop varieties adapted to climate change can increase the capacity to cope with drought, and public health measures to address vector-borne diseases can enhance the capacity of health systems to address other challenges. Similarly, locating infrastructure away from low-lying coastal areas helps settlements and ecosystems adapt to sea level rise while also protecting against tsunamis. However, some adaptation options may have adverse side effects that imply real or perceived trade-offs with other adaptation objectives, mitigation objectives or broader development goals. For example, while protection of ecosystems can assist adaptation to climate change and enhance carbon storage, increased use of air conditioning to maintain thermal comfort in buildings or the use of desalination to enhance water resource security can increase energy demand, and therefore, GHG emissions.

Text: The text discusses the importance of both adaptation and mitigation in response to climate change. Throughout history, humans have adapted to climate variability and extremes, and this experience can provide valuable opportunities for learning and refinement in today's changing climate. Adaptation is being integrated into various planning processes, with a focus on engineered and technological options as well as social, institutional, and ecosystem-based measures. Governments at different levels are developing adaptation plans and policies, and examples of adaptation can be found worldwide. However, global increases in anthropogenic emissions and climate impacts have continued, and the full impact of mitigation initiatives, which have been implemented in many parts of the world, is yet to be assessed.</s>  The text discusses various adaptation response options to climate change across different sectors and regions, highlighting the unique challenges and potential co-benefits for each. Some sectors, such as freshwater resources, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, coastal systems and marine systems, have specific adaptation approaches. These include techniques like scenario planning, integrated water management, and ecosystem-based approaches.  The text emphasizes the importance of social, institutional, and ecosystem-based measures in enabling adaptation planning and implementation. It also recognizes the constraints to adaptation and the need for effective strategies that consider co-benefits and opportunities within wider strategic goals and development plans.  The text provides examples of adaptation approaches for different sectors, such as freshwater resources, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, coastal systems and marine systems, food production systems, urban areas, and human health, security, and livelihoods. It highlights the potential for co-benefits and synergies between adaptation and mitigation and among different adaptation responses.  The text also acknowledges the limitations and constraints of certain adaptation options, such as translocation of species for ecosystems at risk and the efficacy of adaptation options for coral reef systems as thermal stress and ocean acidification increase. It also emphasizes the importance of reducing non-climatic stressors, such as habitat modification, overexploitation, pollution, and invasive species, to increase the inherent capacity of ecosystems and their species to adapt to a changing climate.  The text concludes by emphasizing the need for effective governance, alignment of policies and incentives, and appropriate financing and institutional development to enable adaptation planning and implementation in urban areas and key economic sectors and services. It also highlights the importance of addressing the needs of low-income groups and vulnerable communities in urban areas and the potential for significant co-benefits and synergies between adaptation and mitigation and among different adaptation responses.</s>  The text discusses the progress and key takeaways of adaptation experiences in various sectors and regions. The emphasis is on incremental adjustments, co-benefits, flexibility, and learning. National governments play a crucial role in adaptation planning and implementation, with significant progress since the AR4 in developing national strategies and plans. Local governments and the private sector are increasingly recognized as critical to adaptation progress, with an increase in planned adaptation responses at the local level. Institutional dimensions of adaptation governance, including coordination between different levels and sectors, are essential in promoting the transition from planning to implementation. Economic instruments, such as public-private finance partnerships and risk financing mechanisms, can foster adaptation but require attention to design challenges to avoid disincentives and market failure. Existing and emerging economic instruments, including public-private finance partnerships, loans, payments for environmental services, improved resource pricing, charges and subsidies, norms and regulations, and risk sharing and transfer mechanisms, can provide incentives for anticipating and reducing impacts. Institutional barriers or enablers for adaptation planning and implementation include multilevel institutional coordination, key actors and champions, horizontal interplay between sectors, political dimensions, and coordination between formal governmental, administrative agencies, and private sectors and stakeholders.</s>  [/INST]","The text emphasizes the importance of both adaptation and mitigation in response to climate change.

Text: Response options for mitigation  Mitigation options are available in every major sector. Mitigation can be more cost-effective if using an integrated approach that combines measures to reduce energy use and the greenhouse gas intensity of end-use sectors, decarbonize energy supply, reduce net emissions and enhance carbon sinks in land-based sectors. A broad range of sectoral mitigation options is available that can reduce GHG emission intensity, improve energy intensity through enhancements of technology, behaviour, production and resource efficiency and enable structural changes or changes in activity. In addition, direct options in agriculture, forestry and other land use involve reducing CO2 emissions by reducing deforestation, forest degradation and forest fires; storing carbon in terrestrial systems; and providing bioenergy feedstocks. Options to reduce non-CO2 emissions exist across all sectors but most notably in agriculture, energy supply and industry. An overview of sectoral mitigation options and potentials is provided in Table 4.4.  Well-designed systemic and cross-sectoral mitigation strategies are more cost-effective in cutting emissions than a focus on individual technologies and sectors with efforts in one sector affecting the need for mitigation in others . In baseline scenarios without new mitigation policies, GHG emissions are projected to grow in all sectors, except for net CO2 emissions in the AFOLU sector. Mitigation scenarios reaching around 450 ppm CO2-eq concentration by 21004328 show largescale global changes in the energy supply sector . While rapid decarbonization of energy supply generally entails more flexibility for end-use and AFOLU sectors, stronger demand reductions lessen the mitigation challenge for the supply side of the energy system. There are thus strong interdependencies across sectors and the resulting distribution of the mitigation effort is strongly influenced by the availability and performance of future technologies, particularly BECCS and large scale afforestation . The next two decades present a window of opportunity for mitigation in urban areas, as a large portion of the world’s urban areas will be developed during this period.  Decarbonizing electricity generation is a key component of cost-effective mitigation strategies in achieving low stabilization levels  . In most integrated modelling scenarios, decarbonization happens more rapidly in electricity generation than in the industry, buildings and transport sectors. In scenarios reaching 450 ppm CO2-eq concentrations by 2100, global CO2 emissions from the energy supply sector are projected to decline over the next decade and are characterized by reductions of 90% or more below 2010 levels between 2040 and 2070.  Efficiency enhancements and behavioural changes, in order to reduce energy demand compared to baseline scenarios without compromising development, are a key mitigation strategy in scenarios reaching atmospheric CO2-eq concentrations of about 450 to about 500 ppm by 2100 . Near-term reductions in energy demand are an important element of cost-effective mitigation strategies, provide more flexibility for reducing carbon intensity in the energy supply sector, hedge against related supply-side risks, avoid lock-in to carbon-intensive infrastructures and are associated with important co-benefits . Emissions can be substantially lowered through changes in consumption patterns  and dietary change and reduction in food wastes. A number of options including monetary and non-monetary incentives as well as information measures may facilitate behavioural changes.  Decarbonization of the energy supply sector  requires upscaling of low- and zero-carbon electricity generation technologies. In the majority of low-concentration stabilization scenarios , the share of low-carbon electricity supply, nuclear and CCS, including BECCS) increases from the current share of approximately 30% to more than 80% by 2050 and 90% by 2100, and fossil fuel power generation without CCS is phased out almost entirely by 2100. Among these low-carbon technologies, a growing number of RE technologies have achieved a level of maturity to enable deployment at significant scale since AR4 and nuclear energy is a mature low-GHG emission source of baseload power, but its share of global electricity generation has been declining. GHG emissions from energy supply can be reduced significantly by replacing current world average coal-fired power plants with modern, highly efficient natural gas combined-cycle power plants or combined heat and power plants, provided that natural gas is available and the fugitive emissions associated with extraction and supply are low or mitigated.  Behaviour, lifestyle and culture have a considerable influence on energy use and associated emissions, with high mitigation potential in some sectors, in particular when complementing technological and structural change . In the transport sector, technical and behavioural mitigation measures for all modes, plus new infrastructure and urban redevelopment investments, could reduce final energy demand significantly below baseline levels. While opportunities for switching to low-carbon fuels exist, the rate of decarbonization in the transport sector might be constrained by challenges associated with energy storage and the relatively low energy density of low-carbon transport fuels. In the building sector, recent advances in technologies, know-how and policies provide opportunities to stabilize or reduce global energy use to about current levels by mid-century. In addition, recent improvements in performance and costs make very low energy construction and retrofits of buildings economically attractive, sometimes even at net negative costs. In the industry sector, improvements in GHG emission efficiency and in the efficiency of material use, recycling and reuse of materials and products, and overall reductions in product demand  and service demand could, in addition to energy efficiency, help reduce GHG emissions below the baseline level. Prevalent approaches for promoting energy efficiency in industry include information programmes followed by economic instruments, regulatory approaches and voluntary actions. Important options for mitigation in waste management are waste reduction, followed by re-use, recycling and energy recovery.  The most cost-effective mitigation options in forestry are afforestation, sustainable forest management and reducing deforestation, with large differences in their relative importance across regions. In agriculture, the most cost-effective mitigation options are cropland management, grazing land management and restoration of organic soils . About a third of mitigation potential in forestry can be achieved at a cost <20 USD/tCO2-eq emission. Demand-side measures, such as changes in diet and reductions of losses in the food supply chain, have a significant, but uncertain, potential to reduce GHG emissions from food production .  Bioenergy can play a critical role for mitigation, but there are issues to consider, such as the sustainability of practices and the efficiency of bioenergy systems . Evidence suggests that bioenergy options with low lifecycle emissions, some already available, can reduce GHG emissions; outcomes are site-specific and rely on efficient integrated ‘biomassto-bioenergy systems’, and sustainable land use management and governance. Barriers to large-scale deployment of bioenergy include concerns about GHG emissions from land, food security, water resources, biodiversity conservation and livelihoods.  Mitigation measures intersect with other societal goals, creating the possibility of co-benefits or adverse side-effects. These intersections, if well-managed, can strengthen the basis for undertaking climate mitigation actions . Mitigation can positively or negatively influence the achievement of other societal goals, such as those related to human health, food security, biodiversity, local environmental quality, energy access, livelihoods and equitable sustainable development . On the other hand, policies towards other societal goals can influence the achievement of mitigation and adaptation objectives. These influences can be substantial, although sometimes difficult to quantify, especially in welfare terms. This multi-objective perspective is important in part because it helps to identify areas where support for policies that advance multiple goals will be robust. Potential co-benefits and adverse side effects of the main sectoral mitigation measures are summarized in Table 4.5. Overall, the potential for co-benefits for energy end-use measures outweigh the potential for adverse side effects, whereas the evidence suggests this may not be the case for all energy supply and AFOLU measures. [/INST]","The text discusses various mitigation options to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across different sectors. The most effective mitigation strategies involve an integrated approach that combines measures to reduce energy use and the GHG intensity of end-use sectors, decarbonize energy supply, and enhance carbon sinks in land-based sectors. Some key sectoral mitigation options include:

1. Energy supply: Decarbonizing electricity generation is crucial for cost-effective mitigation strategies. In most scenarios, decarbonization happens more rapidly in electricity generation than in other sectors. By 2100, global CO2 emissions from the energy supply sector are projected to decline significantly.
2. Urban areas: The next two decades present an opportunity for mitigation in urban areas, as a large portion of the world's urban areas will be developed during this period.
3. End-use sectors: Efficiency enhancements and behavioral changes are essential for reducing energy demand and emissions in sectors like industry, buildings, and transport.
4. Agriculture and forestry: Afforestation, sustainable forest management, reducing deforestation, and restoring organic soils are cost-effective mitigation options in forestry. In agriculture, cropland management, grazing land management, and restoration of organic soils are the most effective mitigation options.
5. Behavior, lifestyle, and culture: Changes in consumption patterns, dietary change, and reduction in food wastes can significantly reduce GHG emissions.
6. Waste management: Waste reduction, followed by re-use, recycling, and energy recovery, are important options for mitigation in waste management.
7. Co-benefits and adverse side effects: Mitigation measures intersect with other societal goals, creating the possibility of co-benefits or adverse side effects. Energy end-use measures generally have more co-benefits than adverse side effects, while the evidence suggests this may not be the case for all energy supply and AFOLU measures.

Overall, the text emphasizes the importance of an integrated approach to mitigation, with strong interdependencies across sectors.

Text: Response options for mitigation  Mitigation options are available in every major sector. Mitigation can be more cost-effective if using an integrated approach that combines measures to reduce energy use and the greenhouse gas intensity of end-use sectors, decarbonize energy supply, reduce net emissions and enhance carbon sinks in land-based sectors. A broad range of sectoral mitigation options is available that can reduce GHG emission intensity, improve energy intensity through enhancements of technology, behaviour, production and resource efficiency and enable structural changes or changes in activity. In addition, direct options in agriculture, forestry and other land use involve reducing CO2 emissions by reducing deforestation, forest degradation and forest fires; storing carbon in terrestrial systems; and providing bioenergy feedstocks. Options to reduce non-CO2 emissions exist across all sectors but most notably in agriculture, energy supply and industry. An overview of sectoral mitigation options and potentials is provided in Table 4.4.  Well-designed systemic and cross-sectoral mitigation strategies are more cost-effective in cutting emissions than a focus on individual technologies and sectors with efforts in one sector affecting the need for mitigation in others . In baseline scenarios without new mitigation policies, GHG emissions are projected to grow in all sectors, except for net CO2 emissions in the AFOLU sector. Mitigation scenarios reaching around 450 ppm CO2-eq concentration by 21004328 show largescale global changes in the energy supply sector . While rapid decarbonization of energy supply generally entails more flexibility for end-use and AFOLU sectors, stronger demand reductions lessen the mitigation challenge for the supply side of the energy system. There are thus strong interdependencies across sectors and the resulting distribution of the mitigation effort is strongly influenced by the availability and performance of future technologies, particularly BECCS and large scale afforestation . The next two decades present a window of opportunity for mitigation in urban areas, as a large portion of the world’s urban areas will be developed during this period.  Decarbonizing electricity generation is a key component of cost-effective mitigation strategies in achieving low stabilization levels  . In most integrated modelling scenarios, decarbonization happens more rapidly in electricity generation than in the industry, buildings and transport sectors. In scenarios reaching 450 ppm CO2-eq concentrations by 2100, global CO2 emissions from the energy supply sector are projected to decline over the next decade and are characterized by reductions of 90% or more below 2010 levels between 2040 and 2070.  Efficiency enhancements and behavioural changes, in order to reduce energy demand compared to baseline scenarios without compromising development, are a key mitigation strategy in scenarios reaching atmospheric CO2-eq concentrations of about 450 to about 500 ppm by 2100 . Near-term reductions in energy demand are an important element of cost-effective mitigation strategies, provide more flexibility for reducing carbon intensity in the energy supply sector, hedge against related supply-side risks, avoid lock-in to carbon-intensive infrastructures and are associated with important co-benefits . Emissions can be substantially lowered through changes in consumption patterns  and dietary change and reduction in food wastes. A number of options including monetary and non-monetary incentives as well as information measures may facilitate behavioural changes.  Decarbonization of the energy supply sector  requires upscaling of low- and zero-carbon electricity generation technologies. In the majority of low-concentration stabilization scenarios , the share of low-carbon electricity supply, nuclear and CCS, including BECCS) increases from the current share of approximately 30% to more than 80% by 2050 and 90% by 2100, and fossil fuel power generation without CCS is phased out almost entirely by 2100.

Text: The text discusses the enabling factors and constraints for adaptation and mitigation responses to climate change. The enabling factors include effective institutions and governance, innovation and investments in environmentally sound technologies and infrastructure, sustainable livelihoods, and behavioral and lifestyle choices. Innovation and investments in low-carbon and carbon-neutral energy technologies can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance resilience to climate change. However, these efforts are constrained by economic development trends, institutional behavior, and technology, among other factors. Livelihoods, lifestyles, behavior, and culture also play a significant role in vulnerability to climate change and the capacity for adaptation and mitigation. Changes in consumption patterns can lower emissions, while the social acceptability and effectiveness of climate policies depend on regionally appropriate changes in lifestyles or behaviors. Developing nations face unique challenges in pursuing low-carbon, climate-resilient development pathways due to financial, technological, and institutional capacities. Improving institutions and enhancing coordination and cooperation in governance can help overcome regional constraints associated with mitigation, adaptation, and disaster risk reduction. Despite the presence of various institutions focused on adaptation and mitigation, global greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase, and identified adaptation needs have not been adequately addressed. Effective implementation of adaptation and mitigation options may require new institutions and institutional arrangements that span multiple scales.</s>  The text discusses various mitigation options to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across different sectors, including energy supply, agriculture, forestry, and urban areas.

Text: International and regional cooperation  on adaptation and mitigation Because climate change has the characteristics of a collective action problem at the global scale, effective mitigation will not be achieved if individual agents advance their own interests independently, even though mitigation can also have local co-benefits. Cooperative responses, including international cooperation, are therefore required to effectively mitigate GHG emissions and address other climate change issues. While adaptation focuses primarily on local to national scale outcomes, its effectiveness can be enhanced through coordination across governance scales, including international cooperation. In fact, international cooperation has helped to facilitate the creation of adaptation strategies, plans, and actions at national, sub-national, and local levels. A variety of climate policy instruments have been employed, and even more could be employed, at international and regional levels to address mitigation and to support and promote adaptation at national and sub-national scales. Evidence suggests that outcomes seen as equitable can lead to more effective cooperation.  The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is the main multilateral forum focused on addressing climate change, with nearly universal participation. UNFCCC activities since 2007, which include the 2010 Cancún Agreements and the 2011 Durban Platform for Enhanced Action, have sought to enhance actions under the Convention, and have led to an increasing number of institutions and other arrangements for international climate change cooperation. Other institutions organized at different levels of governance have resulted in diversifying international climate change cooperation.  Existing and proposed international climate change cooperation arrangements vary in their focus and degree of centralization and coordination. They span: multilateral agreements, harmonized national policies and decentralized but coordinated national policies, as well as regional and regionally-coordinated policies .  While a number of new institutions are focused on adaptation funding and coordination, adaptation has historically received less attention than mitigation in international climate policy . Inclusion of adaptation is increasingly important to reduce the risk from climate change impacts and may engage a greater number of countries.  The Kyoto Protocol offers lessons towards achieving the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC, particularly with respect to participation, implementation, flexibility mechanisms, and environmental effectiveness. The Protocol was the first binding step toward implementing the principles and goals provided by the UNFCCC. According to national GHG inventories through 2012 submitted to the UNFCCC by October 2013, Annex B Parties with quantified emission limitations  in aggregate may have bettered their collective emission reduction target in the first commitment period, but some emissions reductions that would have occurred even in its absence were also counted. The Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism created a market for emissions offsets from developing countries, the purpose being two-fold: to help Annex I countries fulfill their commitments and to assist non-Annex I countries achieve sustainable development. The CDM generated Certified Emission Reductions equivalent to emissions of over 1.4 GtCO2-eqby October 2013, led to significant project investments, and generated investment flows for a variety of functions, including the UNFCCC Adaptation Fund. However, its environmental effectiveness has been questioned by some, particularly in regard to its early years, due to concerns about the additionality of projects , the validity of baselines, and the possibility of emissions leakage . Such concerns about additionality are common to any emission-reduction-credit program, and are not specific to the CDM. Due to market forces, the majority of single CDM projects have been concentrated in a limited number of countries, while Programmes of Activities, though less frequent, have been more evenly distributed. In addition, the Kyoto Protocol created two other ‘flexibility mechanisms’: Joint Implementation and International Emissions Trading.  Several conceptual models for effort-sharing have been identified in research. However, realized distributional impacts from actual international cooperative agreements depend not only on the approach taken but also on criteria applied to operationalize equity and the manner in which developing countries’ emissions reduction plans are financed.  Policy linkages among regional, national and sub-national climate policies offer potential climate change mitigation benefits. Linkages have been established between carbon markets and in principle could also be established between and among a heterogeneous set of policy instruments including non-market-based policies, such as performance standards. Potential advantages include lower mitigation costs, decreased emission leakage and increased market liquidity.  Regional initiatives between national and global scales are being developed and implemented, but their impact on global mitigation has been limited to date. Some climate policies could be more environmentally and economically effective if implemented across broad regions, such as by embodying mitigation objectives in trade agreements or jointly constructing infrastructures that facilitate reduction in carbon emissions.  International cooperation for supporting adaptation planning and implementation has assisted in the creation of adaptation strategies, plans and actions at national, sub-national and local levels. For example, a range of multilateral and regionally targeted funding mechanisms have been established for adaptation; UN agencies, international development organizations and non-governmental organisations have provided information, methodologies and guidelines; and global and regional initiatives supported and promoted the creation of national adaptation strategies in both developing and developed countries. Closer integration of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation at the international level, and the mainstreaming of both into international development assistance, may foster greater efficiency in the use of resources and capacity. However, stronger efforts at the international level do not necessarily lead to substantive and rapid results at the local level.

Text: The text discusses the importance of adaptation strategies at the national, local, and private sectors in response to climate change. Key takeaways include:  1. Adaptation experiences have focused on incremental adjustments, co-benefits, flexibility, and learning. 2. National governments play a crucial role in adaptation planning and implementation, with significant progress since the AR4 in developing national adaptation strategies and plans. 3. Local governments and the private sector are increasingly recognized as critical to adaptation progress, with a significant increase in planned adaptation responses at the local level. 4. Institutional dimensions of adaptation governance, including coordination between different levels of government and stakeholders, are essential for promoting the transition from planning to implementation. 5. Economic instruments, such as public-private finance partnerships, loans, payments for environmental services, and risk financing mechanisms, can foster adaptation but require careful design to avoid disincentives and market failure. 6. Existing and emerging economic instruments can provide incentives for anticipating and reducing climate change impacts. 7. Challenges remain in implementing local adaptation responses, and linkages with national and sub-national levels of government and partnerships among public, civic, and private sectors are crucial for successful implementation.</s>  The text discusses the progress and trends in national and subnational mitigation strategies and policies since the Assessment Report 4 (AR4) in 2007. The following are the main takeaways:  1. Increase in national and subnational mitigation plans: There has been a significant increase in the number of countries with national legislation or strategies for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with 67% of global emissions subject to such measures in 2012 compared to 45% in 2007. 2. Co-benefits and multiple objectives: There is an increased focus on policies that integrate multiple objectives, increase co-benefits, and reduce adverse side effects. Co-benefits are explicitly referenced in climate and sectoral plans and strategies. 3. Sector-specific policies: Sector-specific policies have been more widely used than economy-wide policies due to administrative and political barriers. Sector-specific policies may be better suited to address barriers or market failures specific to certain sectors and may be bundled in packages of complementary policies. 4. Carbon pricing mechanisms: Mechanisms that set a carbon price, such as cap and trade systems and carbon taxes, can achieve mitigation in a cost-effective way. However, their implementation and effects have been diverse due to national circumstances and policy design. 5. Subsidies and renewable energy: Economic instruments in the form of subsidies, including tax rebates, grants, loans, and credit lines, have driven the growth of renewable energy technologies. The reduction of subsidies for GHG-related activities can achieve emission reductions, depending on the social and economic context. 6. Regulatory approaches and information measures: Regulatory approaches, such as energy efficiency standards, and information measures, such as labelling programs, are widely used and are often environmentally effective. 7. Interactions between mitigation policies: Mitigation policies may have synergistic or no additive effects on reducing emissions. For instance, a carbon tax can have an additive environmental effect to policies such as subsidies for the supply of renewable energy. 8. Co-benefits and adverse side effects: Mitigation policies could affect achievement of other objectives, such as those related to human health, food security, biodiversity, local environmental quality, energy access, livelihoods, and equitable sustainable development. Co-benefits and adverse side effects have not been well-quantified. 9. Sub-national climate policies: Sub-national climate policies are increasingly prevalent, both in countries with national policies and in those without. These policies include state and provincial climate plans combining market, regulatory, and information instruments, and sub-national cap-and-trade systems. Transnational cooperation has also arisen among sub-national actors. 10. Mitigation policy and fossil fuel assets: Mitigation policy could devalue fossil fuel assets and reduce revenues for fossil fuel exporters, but the effect on natural gas export revenues is more uncertain. The availability of carbon capture and storage (CCS) would reduce the adverse effect of mitigation on the value of fossil fuel assets. 11. Synergies and interactions between mitigation policies: Interactions between or among mitigation policies may be synergistic or may have no additive effect on reducing emissions. For instance, a carbon tax can have an additive environmental effect to policies such as subsidies for the supply of renewable energy. By contrast, if a cap and trade system has a sufficiently stringent cap to affect emission-related decisions, then other policies have no further impact on reducing emissions. Additional policies may be needed to address market failures relating to innovation and technology diffusion.</s>  [/INST]","The text discusses the importance of both adaptation and mitigation strategies in response to climate change at the national, local, and private sectors.

Text: Mitigation  There has been a considerable increase in national and subnational mitigation plans and strategies since AR4. In 2012, 67% of global GHG emissions were subject to national legislation or strategies versus 45% in 2007. However, there has not yet been a substantial deviation in global emissions from the past trend. These plans and strategies are in their early stages of development and implementation in many countries, making it difficult to assess their aggregate impact on future global emissions.  Since AR4, there has been an increased focus on policies designed to integrate multiple objectives, increase co-benefits and reduce adverse side effects. Governments often explicitly reference co-benefits in climate and sectoral plans and strategies.  Sector-specific policies have been more widely used than economy-wide policies . Although most economic theory suggests that economy-wide policies for mitigation would be more cost-effective than sector-specific policies, administrative and political barriers may make economy-wide policies harder to design and implement than sector-specific policies. The latter may be better suited to address barriers or market failures specific to certain sectors and may be bundled in packages of complementary policies  In principle, mechanisms that set a carbon price, including cap and trade systems and carbon taxes, can achieve mitigation in a cost-effective way, but have been implemented with diverse effects due in part to national circumstances as well as policy design. The short-run environmental effects of cap and trade systems have been limited as a result of loose caps or caps that have not proved to be constraining. In some countries, tax-based policies specifically aimed at reducing GHG emissions—alongside technology and other policies—have helped to weaken the link between GHG emissions and gross domestic product . In addition, in a large group of countries, fuel taxes have had effects that are akin to sectoral carbon taxes . Revenues from carbon taxes or auctioned emission allowances are used in some countries to reduce other taxes and/or to provide transfers to low-income groups. This illustrates the general principle that mitigation policies that raise government revenue generally have lower social costs than approaches which do not.  Economic instruments in the form of subsidies may be applied across sectors, and include a variety of policy designs, such as tax rebates or exemptions, grants, loans and credit lines. An increasing number and variety of RE policies including subsidies—motivated by many factors—have driven escalated growth of RE technologies in recent years. Government policies play a crucial role in accelerating the deployment of RE technologies. Energy access and social and economic development have been the primary drivers in most developing countries whereas secure energy supply and environmental concerns have been most important in developed countries. The focus of policies is broadening from a concentration primarily on RE electricity to include RE heating and cooling and transportation.  The reduction of subsidies for GHG-related activities in various sectors can achieve emission reductions, depending on the social and economic context. While subsidies can affect emissions in many sectors, most of the recent literature has focused on subsidies for fossil fuels. Since AR4 a small but growing literature based on economy-wide models has projected that complete removal of subsidies to fossil fuels in all countries could result in reductions in global aggregate emissions by mid-century . Studies vary in methodology, the type and definition of subsidies and the time frame for phase out considered. In particular, the studies assess the impacts of complete removal of all fossil fuel subsides without seeking to assess which subsidies are wasteful and inefficient, keeping in mind national circumstances.  Regulatory approaches and information measures are widely used and are often environmentally effective . Examples of regulatory approaches include energy efficiency standards; examples of information programmes include labelling programmes that can help consumers make better-informed decisions.  Mitigation policy could devalue fossil fuel assets and reduce revenues for fossil fuel exporters, but differences between regions and fuels exist. Most mitigation scenarios are associated with reduced revenues from coal and oil trade for major exporters. The effect on natural gas export revenues is more uncertain. The availability of CCS would reduce the adverse effect of mitigation on the value of fossil fuel assets.  Interactions between or among mitigation policies may be synergistic or may have no additive effect on reducing emissions . For instance, a carbon tax can have an additive environmental effect to policies such as subsidies for the supply of RE. By contrast, if a cap and trade system has a sufficiently stringent cap to affect emission-related decisions, then other policies have no further impact on reducing emissions  . In either case, additional policies may be needed to address market failures relating to innovation and technology diffusion.  Sub-national climate policies are increasingly prevalent, both in countries with national policies and in those without. These policies include state and provincial climate plans combining market, regulatory and information instruments, and sub-national cap-and-trade systems. In addition, transnational cooperation has arisen among sub-national actors, notably among institutional investors, NGOs seeking to govern carbon offset markets, and networks of cities seeking to collaborate in generating low-carbon urban development.  Co-benefits and adverse side effects of mitigation could affect achievement of other objectives such as those related to human health, food security, biodiversity, local environmental quality, energy access, livelihoods and equitable sustainable development:  • Mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 or 500 ppm CO2-equivalent by 2100 show reduced costs for achieving air quality and energy security objectives, with significant co-benefits for human health, ecosystem impacts and sufficiency of resources and resilience of the energy system.  • Some mitigation policies raise the prices for some energy services and could hamper the ability of societies to expand access to modern energy services to underserved populations . These potential adverse side effects can be avoided with the adoption of complementary policies such as income tax rebates or other benefit transfer mechanisms. The costs of achieving nearly universal access to electricity and clean fuels for cooking and heating are projected to be between USD 72 to 95 billion per year until 2030 with minimal effects on GHG emissions and multiple benefits in health and air pollutant reduction.  Whether or not side effects materialize, and to what extent side effects materialize, will be case- and site-specific, and depend on local circumstances and the scale, scope and pace of implementation.

Text: The text discusses various mitigation options to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across different sectors, including energy supply, agriculture, forestry, and urban areas. The integrated approach to mitigation involves reducing energy use and the GHG intensity of end-use sectors, decarbonizing energy supply, and enhancing carbon sinks in land-based sectors.  Key sectoral mitigation options include reducing CO2 emissions by reducing deforestation, forest degradation, and forest fires; storing carbon in terrestrial systems; and providing bioenergy feedstocks. Decarbonizing electricity generation is a crucial component of cost-effective mitigation strategies. In most integrated modeling scenarios, decarbonization happens more rapidly in electricity generation than in other sectors.  Efficiency enhancements and behavioral changes to reduce energy demand are essential mitigation strategies. Near-term reductions in energy demand provide more flexibility for reducing carbon intensity in the energy supply sector, hedge against related supply-side risks, avoid lock-in to carbon-intensive infrastructures, and are associated with important co-benefits.  Mitigation measures intersect with other societal goals, creating the possibility of co-benefits or adverse side effects. Energy end-use measures have more potential co-benefits than adverse side effects, while the evidence suggests this may not be the case for all energy supply and AFOLU measures.  Mitigation options in forestry include afforestation, sustainable forest management, and reducing deforestation, with large differences in their relative importance across regions. In agriculture, the most cost-effective mitigation options are cropland management, grazing land management, and restoration of organic soils.  Bioenergy can play a critical role in mitigation but comes with issues, such as sustainability practices and the efficiency of bioenergy systems. Bioenergy options with low lifecycle emissions can reduce GHG emissions, but outcomes are site-specific and rely on efficient integrated 'biomass-to-bioenergy systems,' sustainable land use management, and governance.  The text emphasizes the importance of well-designed systemic and cross-sectoral mitigation strategies, as efforts in one sector can affect the need for mitigation in others. The next two decades present a window of opportunity for mitigation in urban areas, as a large portion of the world's urban areas will be developed during this period.  Mitigation measures can positively or negatively influence the achievement of other societal goals, such as human health, food security, biodiversity, local environmental quality, energy access, livelihoods, and equitable sustainable development. Policies towards other societal goals can also influence the achievement of mitigation and adaptation objectives.</s>  The text discusses the progress and challenges of mitigation strategies and policies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions since the Assessment Report 4 (AR4) in 2007. While there has been an increase in national and subnational legislation and strategies, global emissions have not significantly deviated from the past trend. The focus has shifted towards policies that integrate multiple objectives, increase co-benefits, and reduce adverse side effects. Sector-specific policies have been more widely used due to administrative and political barriers for economy-wide policies. Mechanisms such as carbon pricing, subsidies, and regulatory approaches have shown diverse effects. Co-benefits and adverse side effects of mitigation policies can impact various objectives, including human health, food security, biodiversity, and equitable sustainable development. Some mitigation scenarios can lead to reduced costs for achieving air quality and energy security objectives, while others may hamper access to modern energy services for underserved populations.

Co-benefits and adverse side effects of mitigation policies can impact various objectives, including human health, food security, biodiversity, and equitable sustainable development. The text also discusses the progress and challenges of mitigation strategies and policies since the Assessment Report 4 (AR4) in 2007. While there has been an increase in national and subnational legislation and strategies, global emissions have not significantly deviated from the past trend. The focus has shifted towards policies that integrate multiple objectives, increase co-benefits, and reduce adverse side effects. Sector-specific policies have been more widely used due to administrative and political barriers for economy-wide policies. Co-benefits and adverse side effects of mitigation policies can vary depending on local circumstances and the scale, scope, and pace of implementation. Many co-benefits and adverse side effects have not been well-quantified.</s>","0.9730189558517823","0.9669594408296094","0.946169635204123","0.9479271650248239","0.9585187992275847","155.30992698669434"

Text: Technology development and transfer  Technology policy complements other mitigation policies across all scales from international to sub-national, but worldwide investment in research in support of GHG mitigation is small relative to overall public research spending. Technology policy includes technology-push and demand-pull . Such policies address a pervasive market failure because, in the absence of government policy such as patent protection, the invention of new technologies and practices from R&D efforts has aspects of a public good and thus tends to be under-provided by market forces alone. Technology support policies have promoted substantial innovation and diffusion of new technologies, but the cost-effectiveness of such policies is often difficult to assess. Technology policy can increase incentives for participation and compliance with international cooperative efforts, particularly in the long run.  Many adaptation efforts also critically rely on diffusion and transfer of technologies and management practices, but their effective use depends on a suitable institutional, regulatory, social and cultural context. Adaptation technologies are often familiar and already applied elsewhere. However, the success of technology transfer may involve not only the provision of finance and information, but also strengthening of policy and regulatory environments and capacities to absorb, employ and improve technologies appropriate to local circumstances.

Text: Investment and finance  Substantial reductions in emissions would require large changes in investment patterns. Mitigation scenarios in which policies stabilize atmospheric concentrations  in the range from 430 to 530 ppm CO2-eq by 21004530 lead to substantial shifts in annual investment flows during the period 2010–2029 compared to baseline scenarios. Over the next two decades , annual investments in conventional fossil fuel technologies associated with the electricity supply sector are projected to decline in the scenarios by about USD 30 billion  while annual investment in low carbon electricity supply is projected to rise in the scenarios by about USD 147 billion  . In addition, annual incremental energy efficiency investments in transport, industry and buildings is projected to rise in the scenarios by about USD 336 billion. Global total annual investment in the energy system is presently about USD 1, billion. This number includes only energy supply of electricity and heat and respective upstream and downstream activities. Energy efficiency investment or underlying sector investment is not included.  There is no widely agreed definition of what constitutes climate finance, but estimates of the financial flows associated with climate change mitigation and adaptation are available. See Figure 4.5 for an overview of climate finance flows. Published assessments of all current annual financial flows whose expected effect is to reduce net GHG emissions and/or to enhance resilience to climate change and climate variability show USD 343 to 385 billion per year globally. Out of this, total public climate finance that flowed to developing countries is estimated to be between USD 35 and 49 billion per year in 2011 and 2012. Estimates of international private climate finance flowing to developing countries range from USD 10 to 72 billion per year including foreign direct investment as equity and loans in the range of USD 10 to 37 billion per year over the period of 2008–2011.  In many countries, the private sector plays central roles in the processes that lead to emissions as well as to mitigation and adaptation. Within appropriate enabling environments, the private sector, along with the public sector, can play an important role in financing mitigation and adaptation . The share of total mitigation finance from the private sector, acknowledging data limitations, is estimated to be on average between two-thirds and three-fourths on the global level . In many countries, public finance interventions by governments and international development banks encourage climate investments by the private sector and provide finance where private sector investment is limited. The quality of a country’s enabling environment includes the effectiveness of its institutions, regulations and guidelines regarding the private sector, security of property rights, credibility of policies and other factors that have a substantial impact on whether private firms invest in new technologies and infrastructures. Dedicated policy instruments and financial arrangements, for example, credit insurance, feed-in tariffs, concessional finance or rebates provide an incentive for mitigation investment by improving the return adjusted for the risk for private actors. Public-private risk reduction initiatives  and economic diversification are examples of adaptation action enabling and relying on private sector participation.  Financial resources for adaptation have become available more slowly than for mitigation in both developed and developing countries. Limited evidence indicates that there is a gap between global adaptation needs and the funds available for adaptation. Potential synergies between international finance for disaster risk management and adaptation to climate change have not yet been fully realized. There is a need for better assessment of global adaptation costs, funding and investment. Studies estimating the global cost of adaptation are characterized by shortcomings in data, methods and coverage .

Text: Interaction among mitigation, adaptation  and sustainable development Climate change is a threat to equitable and sustainable development. Adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development are closely related, with potential for synergies and trade-offs. Climate change poses an increasing threat to equitable and sustainable development. Some climate-related impacts on development are already being observed. Climate change is a threat multiplier. It exacerbates other threats to social and natural systems, placing additional burdens particularly on the poor and constraining possible development paths for all. Development along current global pathways can contribute to climate risk and vulnerability, further eroding the basis for sustainable development.  Aligning climate policy with sustainable development requires attention to both adaptation and mitigation. Interaction among adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development occurs both within and across regions and scales, often in the context of multiple stressors. Some options for responding to climate change could impose risks of other environmental and social costs, have adverse distributional effects and draw resources away from other development priorities, including poverty eradication.  Both adaptation and mitigation can bring substantial co-benefits . Examples of actions with co-benefits include improved air quality; enhanced energy security, reduced energy and water consumption in urban areas through greening cities and recycling water; sustainable agriculture and forestry; and protection of ecosystems for carbon storage and other ecosystem services.  Strategies and actions can be pursued now that will move towards climate-resilient pathways for sustainable development, while at the same time helping to improve livelihoods, social and economic well-being and effective environmental management. Prospects for climate-resilient pathways are related fundamentally to what the world accomplishes with climate change mitigation. Since mitigation reduces the rate as well as the magnitude of warming, it also increases the time available for adaptation to a particular level of climate change, potentially by several decades. Delaying mitigation actions may reduce options for climate-resilient pathways in the future. Trade-offs, synergies and integrated responses  There are many opportunities to link mitigation, adaptation and the pursuit of other societal objectives through integrated responses. Successful implementation relies on relevant tools, suitable governance structures and enhanced capacity to respond. A growing evidence base indicates close links between adaptation and mitigation, their co-benefits and adverse side effects, and recognizes sustainable development as the overarching context for climate policy . Developing tools to address these linkages is critical to the success of climate policy in the context of sustainable development. This section presents examples of integrated responses in specific policy arenas, as well as some of the factors that promote or impede policies aimed at multiple objectives. Increasing efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change imply an increasing complexity of interactions, encompassing connections among human health, water, energy, land use and biodiversity. Mitigation can support the achievement of other societal goals, such as those related to human health, food security, environmental quality, energy access, livelihoods and sustainable development, although there can also be negative effects. Adaptation measures also have the potential to deliver mitigation co-benefits, and vice versa, and support other societal goals, though trade-offs can also arise.  Integration of adaptation and mitigation into planning and decision-making can create synergies with sustainable development. Synergies and trade-offs among mitigation and adaptation policies and policies advancing other societal goals can be substantial, although sometimes difficult to quantify especially in welfare terms. A multi-objective approach to policy-making can help manage these synergies and trade-offs. Policies advancing multiple goals may also attract greater support.  Effective integrated responses depend on suitable tools and governance structures, as well as adequate capacity . Managing trade-offs and synergies is challenging and requires tools to help understand interactions and support decision-making at local and regional scales. Integrated responses also depend on governance that enables coordination across scales and sectors, supported by appropriate institutions. Developing and implementing suitable tools and governance structures often requires upgrading the human and institutional capacity to design and deploy integrated responses.  An integrated approach to energy planning and implementation that explicitly assesses the potential for co-benefits and the presence of adverse side effects can capture complementarities across multiple climate, social and environmental objectives . There are strong interactive effects across various energy policy objectives, such as energy security, air quality, health and energy access and between a range of social and environmental objectives and climate mitigation objectives . An integrated approach can be assisted by tools such as cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, multi-criteria analysis and expected utility theory. It also requires appropriate coordinating institutions.  Explicit consideration of interactions among water, food, energy and biological carbon sequestration plays an important role in supporting effective decisions for climate resilient pathways . Both biofuel-based power generation and large-scale afforestation designed to mitigate climate change can reduce catchment run-off, which may conflict with alternative water uses for food production, human consumption or the maintenance of ecosystem function and services. Conversely, irrigation can increase the climate resilience of food and fibre production but reduces water availability for other uses.  An integrated response to urbanization provides substantial opportunities for enhanced resilience, reduced emissions and more sustainable development. Urban areas account for more than half of global primary energy use and energy-related CO2 emissions and contain a high proportion of the population and economic activities at risk from climate change. In rapidly growing and urbanizing regions, mitigation strategies based on spatial planning and efficient infrastructure supply can avoid the lock-in of high emission patterns. Mixed-use zoning, transport-oriented development, increased density and co-located jobs and homes can reduce direct and indirect energy use across sectors. Compact development of urban spaces and intelligent densification can preserve land carbon stocks and land for agriculture and bioenergy. Reduced energy and water consumption in urban areas through greening cities and recycling water are examples of mitigation actions with adaptation benefits. Building resilient infrastructure systems can reduce vulnerability of urban settlements and cities to coastal flooding, sea level rise and other climate-induced stresses.

Observed warming is human-caused, with warming from greenhouse gases, dominated by CO2 and methane, partly masked by aerosol cooling. Global surface temperature in the first two decades of the 21st century was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2000 years. The likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs 67 contributed a warming of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal variability changed it by ±0.2°C.  Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion of CO2 emissions from human activities over the past six decades, with regional differences. In 2019, atmospheric CO2 concentrations reached 410 parts per million, CH 4 reached 1866 parts per billion and nitrous oxide reached 332 ppb. Other major contributors to warming are tropospheric ozone and halogenated gases. Concentrations of CH 4 and N2 O have increased to levels unprecedented in at least 800, years, and there is high confidence that current CO 2 concentrations are higher than at any time over at least the past two million years. Since 1750, increases in CO 2 and CH4 concentrations far exceed – and increases in N2 O are similar to – the natural multi-millennial changes between glacial and interglacial periods over at least the past 800, years. The net cooling effect which arises from anthropogenic aerosols peaked in the late 20th century .  Average annual GHG emissions during 2010–2019 were higher than in any previous decade, but the rate of growth between 2010 and 2019 was lower than that between 2000 and 2009  69 . Historical cumulative net CO 2 emissions from 1850 to 2019 were 2400 ±240 GtCO2. Of these, more than half occurred between 1850 and 1989 [1400 ±195 GtCO 2], and about 42% between 1990 and 2019 [1000 ±90 GtCO2]. Global net anthropogenic GHG emissions have been estimated to be 59±6.6 GtCO 2 -eq in 2019, about 12% higher than in 2010 and 54% higher than in 1990. By 2019, the largest growth in gross emissions occurred in CO2 from fossil fuels and industry followed by CH4, whereas the highest relative growth occurred in fluorinated gases, starting from low levels in 1990.  Regional contributions to global human-caused GHG emissions continue to differ widely. Historical contributions of CO2 emissions vary substantially across regions in terms of total magnitude, but also in terms of contributions to CO 2 -FFI and net CO2 -LULUCF emissions. Variations in regional and national per capita emissions partly reflect different development stages, but they also vary widely at similar income levels. Average per capita net anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2019 ranged from 2.6 tCO 2-eq to 19 tCO 2-eq across regions. Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States have much lower per capita emissions  than the global average, excluding CO2 -LULUCF. Around 48% of the global population in 2019 lives in countries emitting on average more than 6 tCO 2-eq per capita, 35% of the global population live in countries emitting more than 9 tCO2 -eq per capita while another 41% live in countries emitting less than 3 tCO 2 -eq per capita. A substantial share of the population in these low-emitting countries lack access to modern energy services.  Net GHG emissions have increased since 2010 across all major sectors. In 2019, approximately 34% of net global GHG emissions came from the energy sector, 24% from industry, 22% from AFOLU, 15% from transport and 6% from buildings . Average annual GHG emissions growth between 2010 and 2019 slowed compared to the previous decade in energy supply and industry but remained roughly constant at about 2% yr –1 in the transport sector . About half of total net AFOLU emissions are from CO2 LULUCF, predominantly from deforestation. Land overall constituted a net sink of –6.6 GtCO 2 yr–1 for the period 2010–201972.  Human-caused climate change is a consequence of more than a century of net GHG emissions from energy use, land-use and land use change, lifestyle and patterns of consumption, and production. Emissions reductions in CO2 from fossil fuels and industrial processes, due to improvements in energy intensity of GDP and carbon intensity of energy, have been less than emissions increases from rising global activity levels in industry, energy supply, transport, agriculture and buildings. The 10% of households with the highest per capita emissions contribute 34–45% of global consumption-based household GHG emissions, while the middle 40% contribute 40–53%, and the bottom 50% contribute 13–15%. An increasing share of emissions can be attributed to urban areas . The drivers of urban GHG emissions 73 are complex and include population size, income, state of urbanisation and urban form.

Regional contributions to global human-caused GHG emissions continue to differ widely. Historical contributions of CO2 emissions vary substantially across regions in terms of total magnitude, but also in terms of contributions to CO 2 -FFI and net CO2 -LULUCF emissions. Variations in regional and national per capita emissions partly reflect different development stages, but they also vary widely at similar income levels. Average per capita net anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2019 ranged from 2.6 tCO 2-eq to 19 tCO 2-eq across regions. Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States have much lower per capita emissions  than the global average, excluding CO2 -LULUCF.

[/INST]","The text discusses the observed global warming trend and its causes, with a focus on human-induced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The global surface temperature has increased by approximately 1.1°C above the 1850-1900 baseline between 2011-2020, with a larger increase over land than over the ocean. Human activities, primarily the emission of well-mixed GHGs like CO2 and methane, are the primary cause of observed warming. The text also mentions other human drivers and natural drivers contributing to temperature changes.

The text highlights that CO2 concentrations have been increasing since the industrial revolution and have surpassed levels seen in at least the past 800,000 years. The largest contributors to GHG emissions are the energy sector (34%), industry (24%), agriculture, forestry, and other land use (22%), transport (15%), and buildings (6%). Emissions from fossil fuels and industry have seen the largest growth, while fluorinated gases have seen the highest relative growth.

The text also mentions that human-caused climate change is a consequence of more than a century of net GHG emissions from various sectors, including energy use, land-use and land use change, lifestyle and patterns of consumption, and production. The text emphasizes that emissions reductions from fossil fuels and industrial processes have not kept pace with emissions increases from rising global activity levels in various sectors.

Text: Observed Warming and its Causes  Global surface temperature was around 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020 64, with larger increases over land than over the ocean 65 . Observed warming is human-caused, with warming from greenhouse gases, dominated by CO2 and methane, partly masked by aerosol cooling. Global surface temperature in the first two decades of the 21st century was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2000 years. The likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase from 1850–1900 to 2010–201966 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs 67 contributed a warming of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, and other human drivers contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural drivers changed global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and internal variability changed it by ±0.2°C.  Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions from human activities. Land and ocean sinks have taken up a near-constant proportion of CO2 emissions from human activities over the past six decades, with regional differences. In 2019, atmospheric CO2 concentrations reached 410 parts per million, CH 4 reached 1866 parts per billion and nitrous oxide reached 332 ppb. Other major contributors to warming are tropospheric ozone and halogenated gases. Concentrations of CH 4 and N2 O have increased to levels unprecedented in at least 800, years, and there is high confidence that current CO 2 concentrations are higher than at any time over at least the past two million years. Since 1750, increases in CO 2 and CH4 concentrations far exceed – and increases in N2 O are similar to – the natural multi-millennial changes between glacial and interglacial periods over at least the past 800, years. The net cooling effect which arises from anthropogenic aerosols peaked in the late 20th century .  Average annual GHG emissions during 2010–2019 were higher than in any previous decade, but the rate of growth between 2010 and 2019 was lower than that between 2000 and 2009  69 . Historical cumulative net CO 2 emissions from 1850 to 2019 were 2400 ±240 GtCO2. Of these, more than half occurred between 1850 and 1989 [1400 ±195 GtCO 2], and about 42% between 1990 and 2019 [1000 ±90 GtCO2].

Text: The text emphasizes the undeniable impact of human influence on climate change, with widespread and rapid changes observed in various aspects of the climate system. The global upper ocean has warmed significantly since the 1970s, and human influence is the main driver. Ocean warming accounted for 91% of the heating in the climate system, with land warming, ice loss, and atmospheric warming contributing to the remaining 5%, 3%, and 1%, respectively.  Sea level rise has also increased, with an average rate of 1.3 mm yr-1 between 1901 and 1971, 1.9 mm yr-1 between 1971 and 2006, and further increasing to 3.7 mm yr-1 between 2006 and 2018. Human influence is the main driver of these increases since at least 1971.  Human influence has contributed to the global retreat of glaciers since the 1990s and the decrease in Arctic sea ice area between 1979-1988 and 2010-2019. Human-caused CO2 emissions are the main driver of current global acidification of the surface open ocean.  Climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes, with evidence strengthening since the last assessment. Hot extremes have become more frequent and intense across most land regions since the 1950s, while cold extremes have become less frequent and less severe. Marine heatwaves have approximately doubled in frequency since the 1980s, and human influence has very likely contributed to most of them since at least 2006.  Climate change has caused substantial damages and increasingly irreversible losses in various ecosystems, with impacts larger than previously estimated. Approximately half of the species assessed globally have shifted polewards or to higher elevations, and biological responses are often not sufficient to cope with recent climate change. Hundreds of local losses of species have been driven by increases in the magnitude of heat extremes and mass mortality events on land and in the ocean.  Climate change has contributed to desertification and exacerbated land degradation, particularly in low-lying coastal areas, river deltas, drylands, and permafrost areas. Nearly 50% of coastal wetlands have been lost over the last 100 years. Climate change has reduced food security and affected water security, hindering efforts to meet Sustainable Development Goals.  Climate change has caused adverse impacts on human health, livelihoods, and key infrastructure, particularly in urban settings. Extreme and slow-onset events have led to economic losses, disruptions of services, and impacts to well-being. Climate change has also contributed to displacement and involuntary migration, generating and perpetuating vulnerability.  Economic damages from climate change are increasingly affecting peoples' livelihoods and causing economic and societal impacts across national boundaries. Climate change has caused widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people, with losses and damages unequally distributed across systems, regions, and sectors. Vulnerability is higher in locations with poverty, governance challenges, and limited access to basic services and resources, violent conflict, and high levels of climate-sensitive livelihoods.

Other adaptations in agriculture include cultivar improvements, agroforestry, community-based adaptation and farm and landscape diversification among others. For inland flooding, combinations of non-structural measures like early warning systems, enhancing natural water retention such as by restoring wetlands and rivers, and land use planning such as no build zones or upstream forest management, can reduce flood risk . Some land-related adaptation actions such as sustainable food production, improved and sustainable forest management, soil organic carbon management, ecosystem conservation and land restoration, reduced deforestation and degradation, and reduced food loss and waste are being undertaken, and can have mitigation co-benefits. Adaptation actions that increase the resilience of biodiversity and ecosystem services to climate change include responses like minimising additional stresses or disturbances, reducing fragmentation, increasing natural habitat extent, connectivity and heterogeneity, and protecting small-scale refugia where microclimate conditions can allow species to persist.

Individuals and households in low lying coastal areas in Australasia and Small Islands and smallholder farmers in Central and South America, Africa, Europe and Asia have reached soft limits, resulting from financial, governance, institutional and policy constraints and can be overcome by addressing these constraints. Transitioning from incremental to transformational adaptation can help overcome soft adaptation limits .  Adaptation does not prevent all losses and damages, even with effective adaptation and before reaching soft and hard limits. Losses and damages are unequally distributed across systems, regions and sectors and are not comprehensively addressed by current financial, governance and institutional arrangements, particularly in vulnerable developing countries.  There is increased evidence of maladaptation in various sectors and regions. Examples of maladaptation are observed in urban areas , agriculture , ecosystems (e.g. fire suppression in naturally Lack of Finance as a Barrier to Climate Action  Insufficient financing, and a lack of political frameworks and incentives for finance, are key causes of the implementation gaps for both mitigation and adaptation. Financial flows remained heavily focused on mitigation, are uneven, and have developed heterogeneously across regions and sectors. In 2018, public and publicly mobilised private climate finance flows from developed to developing countries were below the collective goal under the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement to mobilise USD 100 billion per year by 2020 in the context of meaningful mitigation action and transparency on implementation . Public and private finance flows for fossil fuels are still greater than those for climate adaptation and mitigation . The overwhelming majority of tracked climate finance is directed towards mitigation. Nevertheless, average annual modelled investment requirements for 2020 to 2030 in scenarios that limit warming to 2°C or 1.5°C are a factor of three to six greater than current levels, and total mitigation investments would need to increase across all sectors and regions. Challenges remain for green bonds and similar products, in particular around integrity and additionality, as well as the limited applicability of these markets to many developing countries.  Current global financial flows for adaptation including from public and private finance sources, are insufficient for and constrain implementation of adaptation options, especially in developing countries. There are widening disparities between the estimated costs of adaptation and the documented finance allocated to adaptation. Adaptation finance needs are estimated to be higher than those assessed in AR5, and the enhanced mobilisation of and access to financial resources are essential for implementation of adaptation and to reduce adaptation gaps. Annual finance flows targeting adaptation for Africa, for example, are billions of USD less than the lowest adaptation cost estimates for near-term climate change. Adverse climate impacts can further reduce the availability of financial resources by causing losses and damages and impeding national economic growth, thereby further increasing financial constraints for adaptation particularly for developing countries and LDCs.  Without effective mitigation and adaptation, losses and damages will continue to disproportionately affect the poorest and most vulnerable populations. Accelerated financial support for developing countries from developed countries and other sources is a critical enabler to enhance mitigation action . Many developing countries lack comprehensive data at the scale needed and lack adequate financial resources needed for adaptation for reducing associated economic and non-economic losses and damages.  There are barriers to redirecting capital towards climate action both within and outside the global financial sector. These barriers include: the inadequate assessment of climate-related risks and investment opportunities, regional mismatch between available capital and investment needs, home bias factors, country indebtedness levels, economic vulnerability, and limited institutional capacities. Challenges from outside the financial sector include: limited local capital markets; unattractive risk-return profiles, in particular due to missing or weak regulatory environments that are inconsistent with ambition levels; limited institutional capacity to ensure safeguards; standardisation, aggregation, scalability and replicability of investment opportunities and financing models; and, a pipeline ready for commercial investments. [/INST]","The text discusses the existence of adaptation gaps, which is the difference between current adaptation efforts and what is needed to address climate risks. Adaptation initiatives are often focused on near-term risk reduction through hard measures, limiting opportunities for transformational adaptation. Observed adaptation is fragmented, small in scale, and unequally distributed, with the largest gaps in regions managing complex risks and among lower income population groups.

Soft and hard adaptation limits have already been reached in some sectors and regions, including ecosystems and individuals in low-lying areas. Transitioning from incremental to transformational adaptation can help overcome soft limits. However, losses and damages are still unequally distributed and not comprehensively addressed by current financial, governance, and institutional arrangements.

Insufficient financing and a lack of political frameworks and incentives for finance are key causes of implementation gaps for both mitigation and adaptation. Financial flows for adaptation are insufficient, particularly in developing countries, and there are widening disparities between estimated adaptation costs and documented finance allocated to adaptation.

Text: Mitigation Actions to Date  There has been a consistent expansion of policies and laws addressing mitigation since AR5. Climate governance supports mitigation by providing frameworks through which diverse actors interact, and a basis for policy development and implementation. Many regulatory and economic instruments have already been deployed successfully. By 2020, laws primarily focussed on reducing GHG emissions existed in 56 countries covering 53% of global emissions. The application of diverse policy instruments for mitigation at the national and sub-national levels has grown consistently across a range of sectors. Policy coverage is uneven across sectors and remains limited for emissions from agriculture, and from industrial materials and feedstocks.  Practical experience has informed economic instrument design and helped to improve predictability, environmental effectiveness, economic efficiency, alignment with distributional goals, and social acceptance. Low-emission technological innovation is strengthened through the combination of technology-push policies, together with policies that create incentives for behaviour change and market opportunities. Comprehensive and consistent policy packages have been found to be more effective than single policies. Combining mitigation with policies to shift development pathways, policies that induce lifestyle or behaviour changes, for example, measures promoting walkable urban areas combined with electrification and renewable energy can create health co-benefits from cleaner air and enhanced active mobility . Climate governance enables mitigation by providing an overall direction, setting targets, mainstreaming climate action across policy domains and levels, based on national circumstances and in the context of international cooperation. Effective governance enhances regulatory certainty, creating specialised organisations and creating the context to mobilise finance. These functions can be promoted by climate-relevant laws, which are growing in number, or climate strategies, among others, based on national and sub-national context. Effective and equitable climate governance builds on engagement with civil society actors, political actors, businesses, youth, labour, media, Indigenous Peoples and local communities.  The unit costs of several low-emission technologies, including solar, wind and lithium-ion batteries, have fallen consistently since 2010. Design and process innovations in combination with the use of digital technologies have led to near-commercial availability of many low or zero emissions options in buildings, transport and industry. From 2010-2019, there have been sustained decreases in the unit costs of solar energy , wind energy, and lithium-ion batteries, and large increases in their deployment, e.g., >10× for solar and >100× for electric vehicles, albeit varying widely across regions. Electricity from PV and wind is now cheaper than electricity from fossil sources in many regions, electric vehicles are increasingly competitive with internal combustion engines, and large-scale battery storage on electricity grids is increasingly viable. In comparison to modular small-unit size technologies, the empirical record shows that multiple large-scale mitigation technologies, with fewer opportunities for learning, have seen minimal cost reductions and their adoption has grown slowly. Maintaining emission-intensive systems may, in some regions and sectors, be more expensive than transitioning to low emission systems.  For almost all basic materials – primary metals, building materials and chemicals – many low- to zero-GHG intensity production processes are at the pilot to near-commercial and in some cases commercial stage but they are not yet established industrial practice. Integrated design in construction and retrofit of buildings has led to increasing examples of zero energy or zero carbon buildings. Technological innovation made possible the widespread adoption of LED lighting. Digital technologies including sensors, the internet of things, robotics, and artificial intelligence can improve energy management in all sectors; they can increase energy efficiency, and promote the adoption of many low-emission technologies, including decentralised renewable energy, while creating economic opportunities. However, some of these climate change mitigation gains can be reduced or counterbalanced by growth in demand for goods and services due to the use of digital devices. Several mitigation options, notably solar energy, wind energy, electrification of urban systems, urban green infrastructure, energy efficiency, demand side management, improved forest- and crop/grassland management, and reduced food waste and loss, are technically viable, are becoming increasingly cost effective and are generally supported by the public, and this enables expanded deployment in many regions.  The magnitude of global climate finance flows has increased and financing channels have broadened. Annual tracked total financial flows for climate mitigation and adaptation increased by up to 60% between 2013/14 and 2019/20, but average growth has slowed since 2018 and most climate finance stays within national borders. Markets for green bonds, environmental, social and governance and sustainable finance products have expanded significantly since AR5 . Investors, central banks, and financial regulators are driving increased awareness of climate risk to support climate policy development and implementation. Accelerated international financial cooperation is a critical enabler of low-GHG and just transitions.  Economic instruments have been effective in reducing emissions, complemented by regulatory instruments mainly at the national and also sub-national and regional level. By 2020, over 20% of global GHG emissions were covered by carbon taxes or emissions trading systems, although coverage and prices have been insufficient to achieve deep reductions. Equity and distributional impacts of carbon pricing instruments can be addressed by using revenue from carbon taxes or emissions trading to support low-income households, among other approaches. The mix of policy instruments which reduced costs and stimulated adoption of solar energy, wind energy and lithium-ion batteries includes public R&D, funding for demonstration and pilot projects, and demand-pull instruments such as deployment subsidies to attain scale .  Mitigation actions, supported by policies, have contributed to a decrease in global energy and carbon intensity between 2010 and 2019, with a growing number of countries achieving absolute GHG emission reductions for more than a decade . While global net GHG emissions have increased since 2010, global energy intensity decreased by 2% yr –1 between 2010 and 2019. Global carbon intensity also decreased by 0.3% yr –1 , mainly due to fuel switching from coal to gas, reduced expansion of coal capacity, and increased use of renewables, and with large regional variations over the same period. In many countries, policies have enhanced energy efficiency, reduced rates of deforestation and accelerated technology deployment, leading to avoided and in some cases reduced or removed emissions. At least 18 countries have sustained production-based CO2 and GHG and consumption-based CO2 absolute emission reductions for longer than 10 years since 2005 through energy supply decarbonization, energy efficiency gains, and energy demand reduction, which resulted from both policies and changes in economic structure. Some countries have reduced production-based GHG emissions by a third or more since peaking, and some have achieved reduction rates of around 4% yr–1 for several years consecutively. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that mitigation policies have led to avoided global emissions of several GtCO 2-eq yr–1. At least 1.8 GtCO2-eq yr–1 of avoided emissions can be accounted for by aggregating separate estimates for the effects of economic and regulatory instruments. Growing numbers of laws and executive orders have impacted global emissions and are estimated to have resulted in 5.9 GtCO2 -eq yr–1 of avoided emissions in 2016. These reductions have only partly offset global emissions growth.

Text: The Gap Between Mitigation Policies, Pledges and  Pathways that Limit Warming to 1.5°C or Below 2°C Global GHG emissions in 2030 associated with the implementation of NDCs announced prior to COP2691 would make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5°C during the 21st century and would make it harder to limit warming below 2°C – if no additional commitments are made or actions taken. A substantial ‘emissions gap’ exists as global GHG emissions in 2030 associated with the implementation of NDCs announced prior to COP26 would be similar to or only slightly below 2019 emission levels and higher than those associated with modelled mitigation pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot or to 2°C, assuming immediate action, which implies deep, rapid, and sustained global GHG emission reductions this decade  . 92 The magnitude of the emissions gap depends on the global warming level considered and whether only unconditional or also conditional elements of NDCs 93 are considered . Modelled pathways that are consistent with NDCs announced prior to COP26 until 2030 and assume no increase in ambition thereafter have higher emissions, leading to a median global warming of 2.8 [2.1 to 3.4]°C by 2100 . If the ‘emission gap’ is not reduced, global GHG emissions in 2030 consistent with NDCs announced prior to COP26 make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5°C during the 21st century, while limiting warming to 2°C would imply an unprecedented acceleration of mitigation efforts during 2030–2050 .  Policies implemented by the end of 2020 are projected to result in higher global GHG emissions in 2030 than those implied by NDCs, indicating an ‘implementation gap 94 ’ . Projected global emissions implied by policies implemented by the end of 2020 are 57 GtCO2 -eq in 2030. This points to an implementation gap compared with the NDCs of 4 to 7 GtCO 2-eq in 2030; without a strengthening of policies, emissions are projected to rise, leading to a median global warming of 2.2°C to 3.5°C by 2100 .  Projected cumulative future CO2 emissions over the lifetime of existing fossil fuel infrastructure without additional abatement exceed the total cumulative net CO2 emissions in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot. They are approximately equal to total cumulative net CO2 emissions in pathways that limit warming to 2°C with a likelihood of 83% 96. Limiting warming to 2°C or lower will result in stranded assets. About 80% of coal, 50% of gas, and 30% of oil reserves cannot be burned and emitted if warming is limited to 2°C. Significantly more reserves are expected to remain unburned if warming is limited to 1.5°C.  Many countries have signalled an intention to achieve net zero GHG or net zero CO 2 emissions by around mid-century . More than 100 countries have either adopted, announced or are discussing net zero GHG or net zero CO 2 emissions commitments, covering more than two-thirds of global GHG emissions. A growing number of cities are setting climate targets, including net zero GHG targets. Many companies and institutions have also announced net zero emissions targets in recent years. The various net zero emission pledges differ across countries in terms of scope and specificity, and limited policies are to date in place to deliver on them.  All mitigation strategies face implementation challenges, including technology risks, scaling, and costs. Almost all mitigation options also face institutional barriers that need to be addressed to enable their application at scale . Current development pathways may create behavioural, spatial, economic and social barriers to accelerated mitigation at all scales. Choices made by policymakers, citizens, the private sector and other stakeholders influence societies’ development pathways. Structural factors of national circumstances and capabilities  affect the breadth and depth of climate governance. The extent to which civil society actors, political actors, businesses, youth, labour, media, Indigenous Peoples, and local communities are engaged influences political support for climate change mitigation and eventual policy outcomes.  The adoption of low-emission technologies lags in most developing countries, particularly least developed ones, due in part to weaker enabling conditions, including limited finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity . In many countries, especially those with limited institutional capacity, several adverse side-effects have been observed as a result of diffusion of low-emission technology, e.g., low-value employment, and dependency on foreign knowledge and suppliers. Low-emission innovation along with strengthened enabling conditions can reinforce development benefits, which can, in turn, create feedbacks towards greater public support for policy. Persistent and region-specific barriers also continue to hamper the economic and political feasibility of deploying AFOLU mitigation options. Barriers to implementation of AFOLU mitigation include insufficient institutional and financial support, uncertainty over long-term additionality and trade-offs, weak governance, insecure land ownership, low incomes and the lack of access to alternative sources of income, and the risk of reversal . The Timing and Urgency of Climate Action  The magnitude and rate of climate change and associated risks depend strongly on near-term mitigation and adaptation actions . Global warming is more likely than not to reach 1.5°C between 2021 and 2040 even under the very low GHG emission scenarios, and likely or very likely to exceed 1.5°C under higher emissions scenarios 141. Many adaptation options have medium or high feasibility up to 1.5°C , but hard limits to adaptation have already been reached in some ecosystems and the effectiveness of adaptation to reduce climate risk will decrease with increasing warming. Societal choices and actions implemented in this decade determine the extent to which medium- and long-term pathways will deliver higher or lower climate resilient development. Climate resilient development prospects are increasingly limited if current greenhouse gas emissions do not rapidly decline, especially if 1.5°C global warming is exceeded in the near term. Without urgent, effective and equitable adaptation and mitigation actions, climate change increasingly threatens the health and livelihoods of people around the globe, ecosystem health, and biodiversity, with severe adverse consequences for current and future generations. .  In modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot and in those that limit warming to 2°C, assuming immediate actions, global GHG emissions are projected to peak in the early 2020s followed by rapid and deep GHG emissions reductions 142 . In pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, net global GHG emissions are projected to fall by 43 [34 to 60]%143 below 2019 levels by 2030, 60 [49 to 77]% by 2035, 69 [58 to 90]% by 2040 and 84 [73 to 98]% by 2050 144. Global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C have reductions in GHG emissions below 2019 levels of 21 [1 to 42]% by 2030, 35 [22 to 55] % by 2035, 46 [34 to 63] % by 2040 and 64 [53 to 77]% by 2050145. Global GHG emissions associated with NDCs announced prior to COP26 would make it likely that warming would exceed 1.5°C and limiting warming to 2°C would then imply a rapid acceleration of emission reductions during 2030–2050, around 70% faster than in pathways where immediate action is taken to limit warming to 2°C Continued investments in unabated high-emitting infrastructure and limited development and deployment of low-emitting alternatives prior to 2030 would act as barriers to this acceleration and increase feasibility risks.  All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 involve reductions in both net CO 2 emissions and non-CO 2 emissions. For example, in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, global CH4 emissions are reduced by 34 [21 to 57]% below 2019 levels by 2030 and by 44 [31 to 63]% in 2040. Global CH 4 emissions are reduced by 24 [9 to 53]% below 2019 levels by 2030 and by 37 [20 to 60]% in 2040 in modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C with action starting in 2020.  All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 involve GHG emission reductions in all sectors . The contributions of different sectors vary across modelled mitigation pathways. In most global modelled mitigation pathways, emissions from land-use, land-use change and forestry, via reforestation and reduced deforestation, and from the energy supply sector reach net zero CO2 emissions earlier than the buildings, industry and transport sectors. Strategies can rely on combinations of different options, but doing less in one sector needs to be compensated by further reductions in other sectors if warming is to be limited.  Without rapid, deep and sustained mitigation and accelerated adaptation actions, losses and damages will continue to increase, including projected adverse impacts in Africa, LDCs, SIDS, Central and South America , Asia and the Arctic, and will disproportionately affect the most vulnerable populations .

By 2020, laws reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions existed in 56 countries covering 53% of global emissions, but coverage is uneven across sectors. Economic instruments, such as carbon taxes and emissions trading systems, covered over 20% of global GHG emissions. The mix of policy instruments, including public R&D, funding for demonstration projects, and demand-pull instruments, has contributed to the decrease in global energy and carbon intensity.

The text emphasizes the importance of effective governance, international financial cooperation, and technological innovation in enhancing regulatory certainty, creating specialized organizations, and mobilizing finance. The unit costs of solar, wind, and lithium-ion batteries have decreased significantly since 2010, making them increasingly competitive with fossil fuels.

Text: The text discusses the progress made in mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through various policies, laws, and technological innovations since the Assessment Report 5 (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Some key takeaways are:  1. Expansion of policies and laws: Since AR5, there has been a consistent expansion of policies and laws addressing mitigation, with 56 countries covering 53% of global emissions having laws focused on reducing GHG emissions by 2020. 2. Effective governance: Effective governance, including climate-relevant laws and strategies, is essential for mitigation. It provides an overall direction, sets targets, mainstreams climate action, and creates regulatory certainty and financial mobilization. 3. Technological innovation: The unit costs of several low-emission technologies, such as solar, wind, and lithium-ion batteries, have fallen consistently since 2010, making them increasingly cost-effective and competitive with traditional energy sources. 4. Policy packages: Comprehensive and consistent policy packages have been found to be more effective than single policies. Combining mitigation with policies that shift development pathways, promote lifestyle changes, and create economic opportunities can lead to health co-benefits. 5. Financing: The magnitude of global climate finance flows has increased, with significant growth in markets for green bonds, environmental, social, and governance, and sustainable finance products. 6. Economic instruments: Economic instruments, such as carbon taxes and emissions trading systems, have been effective in reducing emissions, but coverage and prices have been insufficient to achieve deep reductions. 7. Mitigation policies: Mitigation policies have led to avoided global emissions of several GtCO2-eq yr–1, with at least 1.8 GtCO2-eq yr–1 accounted for by separate estimates for the effects of economic and regulatory instruments. 8. Progress in emissions reduction: Between 2010 and 2019, there were decreases in global energy and carbon intensity, with a growing number of countries achieving absolute GHG emission reductions for more than a decade. However, global net GHG emissions have continued to increase.  Overall, the text highlights the progress made in mitigating GHG emissions through various policies, laws, and technological innovations since AR5. It emphasizes the importance of effective governance, comprehensive policy packages, and technological innovation in reducing emissions and achieving a low-carbon economy.</s>  The text discusses the gap between countries' mitigation policies, pledges, and pathways to limit global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C by 2030. The implementation of previously announced Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) at COP26 would result in higher emissions, leading to a median global warming of 2.1-3.4°C by 2100. This ""emissions gap"" can be attributed to the lack of additional commitments or actions taken. The text also mentions an ""implementation gap,"" where policies implemented by the end of 2020 result in higher emissions than those implied by NDCs.  The text also discusses the stranded assets that will result from limiting warming to 2°C or lower, with approximately 80% of coal, 50% of gas, and 30% of oil reserves unable to be burned and emitted if warming is limited to 2°C. Many countries have signaled their intention to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) or net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by mid-century, with over 100 countries having net-zero emission pledges covering more than two-thirds of global GHG emissions. However, the text notes that many of these pledges lack specific policies to deliver on them.  The text also discusses the challenges of implementing mitigation strategies, including technology risks, scaling, and costs, as well as institutional barriers that need to be addressed to enable their application at scale. The adoption of low-emission technologies lags in most developing countries, particularly least developed ones, due to weaker enabling conditions. Barriers to implementing Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU) mitigation options include insufficient institutional and financial support, uncertainty over long-term additionality and trade-offs, weak governance, insecure land ownership, low incomes, and the lack of access to alternative sources of income, and the risk of reversal.</s>  The text discusses the financing challenges for both mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The key points are:  1. Insufficient financing for climate action: Financing for climate mitigation and adaptation is insufficient, with public and publicly mobilized private climate finance flows below the collective goal of mobilizing $100 billion per year by 2020. 2. Imbalance in financing: Financing for fossil fuels is greater than that for climate adaptation and mitigation, and the majority of climate finance is directed towards mitigation. 3. Increasing investment requirements: Average annual modelled investment requirements for limiting warming to 2°C or 1.5°C are significantly greater than current levels, and total mitigation investments would need to increase across all sectors and regions. 4. Insufficient financing for adaptation: Current global financial flows for adaptation are insufficient, with widening disparities between the estimated costs and documented finance allocated to adaptation. 5. Disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations: Without effective mitigation and adaptation, losses and damages will continue to disproportionately affect the poorest and most vulnerable populations. 6. Barriers to financing climate action: There are barriers to financing climate action both within and outside the financial sector, including inadequate assessment of climate-related risks and investment opportunities, limited institutional capacities, and unattractive risk-return profiles due to missing or weak regulatory environments. 7. Importance of financial support for developing countries: Accelerated financial support for developing countries is essential to enhance mitigation action and reduce adaptation gaps. 8. Data and institutional capacity challenges: Many developing countries lack comprehensive data and adequate financial resources for adaptation, reducing their ability to reduce associated economic and non-economic losses and damages.</s>  [/INST]","The text highlights the progress made in mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions since the Assessment Report 5 (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) through various policies, laws, and technological innovations.

The main takeaways are:  1. Exceeding a carbon budget results in higher global warming and more severe impacts on human and natural systems. 2. Achieving and sustaining net negative global CO2 emissions (removing more CO2 from the atmosphere than is being emitted) could reverse the temperature exceedance. 3. Reducing emissions of short-lived climate forcers, such as methane, after peak temperature has been reached, can further reduce warming. 4. Only a small number of the most ambitious global modeled pathways limit global warming to 1.5°C without overshoot. 5. Overshooting 1.5°C results in irreversible adverse impacts on certain ecosystems and increases risks of severe impacts, such as increased wildfires and thawing permafrost. 6. The larger the overshoot, the more net negative CO2 emissions are needed to return to a given warming level. 7. Rapid reduction in CO2 and non-CO2 emissions, particularly methane, limits peak warming levels and reduces the requirement for net negative CO2 emissions and carbon capture and storage (CDR).</s>  The text discusses the near-term risks of global warming and the increasing impacts on both natural and human systems.

Losses and damages from climate change will increase with global warming, and will be concentrated among the poorest and most vulnerable populations. 3. Natural variability will modulate human-caused changes, either attenuating or amplifying projected changes, especially at regional scales. 4. Human vulnerability will depend on near-term trends in vulnerability, exposure, socio-economic development, and adaptation. 5. Many climate-associated risks to natural and human systems depend more strongly on changes in vulnerability and exposure than on differences in climate hazards between emissions scenarios. 6. Future exposure to climatic hazards is increasing globally due to socio-economic development trends, including urbanization and migration. 7. Human vulnerability will concentrate in informal settlements and rapidly growing smaller settlements, and vulnerability in rural areas will be heightened by reduced habitability and high reliance on climate-sensitive livelihoods. 8. Several near-term risks can be moderated with adaptation, including increased intensity and frequency of hot extremes, marine heatwaves, extreme rainfall and associated flooding, and sea level rise. 9.

"success","mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2","ALL","B.1.5","<s> [INST] Summarize the main takeaways from the following text with respect to the topic: Natural Variability
Text: Near-Term Risks  Many changes in the climate system, including extreme events, will become larger in the near term with increasing global warming. Multiple climatic and non-climatic risks will interact, resulting in increased compounding and cascading impacts becoming more difficult to manage. Losses and damages will increase with increasing global warming, while strongly concentrated among the poorest vulnerable populations. Continuing with current unsustainable development patterns would increase exposure and vulnerability of ecosystems and people to climate hazards. Global warming will continue to increase in the near term mainly due to increased cumulative CO 2 emissions in nearly all considered scenarios and pathways. In the near term, every region in the world is projected to face further increases in climate hazards , increasing multiple risks to ecosystems and humans. In the near term, natural variability will modulate human-caused changes, either attenuating or amplifying projected changes, especially at regional scales, with little effect on centennial global warming. Those modulations are important to consider in adaptation planning. Global surface temperature in any single year can vary above or below the long-term human-induced trend, due to natural variability. By 2030, global surface temperature in any individual year could exceed 1.5°C relative to 1850–1900 with a probability between 40% and 60%, across the five scenarios assessed in WGI. The occurrence of individual years with global surface temperature change above a certain level does not imply that this global warming level has been reached. If a large explosive volcanic eruption were to occur in the near term 150, it would temporarily and partially mask human-caused climate change by reducing global surface temperature and precipitation, especially over land, for one to three years.  The level of risk for humans and ecosystems will depend on near-term trends in vulnerability, exposure, level of socio-economic development and adaptation. In the near term, many climate-associated risks to natural and human systems depend more strongly on changes in these systems’ vulnerability and exposure than on differences in climate hazards between emissions scenarios . Future exposure to climatic hazards is increasing globally due to socio-economic development trends including growing inequality, and when urbanisation or migration increase exposure . Urbanisation increases hot extremes  and precipitation runoff intensity. Increasing urbanisation in low-lying and coastal zones will be a major driver of increasing exposure to extreme riverflow events and sea level rise hazards, increasing risks. Vulnerability will also rise rapidly in low-lying Small Island Developing States and atolls in the context of sea level rise . Human vulnerability will concentrate in informal settlements and rapidly growing smaller settlements; and vulnerability in rural areas will be heightened by reduced habitability and high reliance on climate-sensitive livelihoods. Human and ecosystem vulnerability are interdependent. Vulnerability to climate change for ecosystems will be strongly influenced by past, present, and future patterns of human development, including from unsustainable consumption and production, increasing demographic pressures, and persistent unsustainable use and management of land, ocean, and water. Several near-term risks can be moderated with adaptation.  Principal hazards and associated risks expected in the near term are: • Increased intensity and frequency of hot extremes and dangerous heat-humidity conditions, with increased human mortality, morbidity, and labour productivity loss.  • Increasing frequency of marine heatwaves will increase risks of biodiversity loss in the oceans, including from mass mortality events.  • Near-term risks for biodiversity loss are moderate to high in forest ecosystems and kelp and seagrass ecosystems and are high to very high in Arctic sea-ice and terrestrial ecosystems and warm-water coral reefs.  • More intense and frequent extreme rainfall and associated flooding in many regions including coastal and other low-lying cities , and increased proportion of and peak wind speeds of intense tropical cyclones.  • High risks from dryland water scarcity, wildfire damage, and permafrost degradation.  • Continued sea level rise and increased frequency and magnitude of extreme sea level events encroaching on coastal human settlements and damaging coastal infrastructure , committing low-lying coastal ecosystems to submergence and loss, expanding land salinization, with cascading to risks to livelihoods, health, well-being, cultural values, food and water security.  • Climate change will significantly increase ill health and premature deaths from the near to long term. Further warming will increase climate-sensitive food-borne, water-borne, and vector-borne disease risks, and mental health challenges including anxiety and stress.  Cryosphere-related changes in floods, landslides, and water availability have the potential to lead to severe consequences for people, infrastructure and the economy in most mountain regions .  • The projected increase in frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation will increase rain-generated local flooding.  Multiple climate change risks will increasingly compound and cascade in the near term. Many regions are projected to experience an increase in the probability of compound events with higher global warming including concurrent heatwaves and drought. Risks to health and food production will be made more severe from the interaction of sudden food production losses from heat and drought, exacerbated by heatinduced labour productivity losses. These interacting impacts will increase food prices, reduce household incomes, and lead to health risks of malnutrition and climate-related mortality with no or low levels of adaptation, especially in tropical regions . Concurrent and cascading risks from climate change to food systems, human settlements, infrastructure and health will make these risks more severe and more difficult to manage, including when interacting with non-climatic risk drivers such as competition for land between urban expansion and food production, and pandemics . Loss of ecosystems and their services has cascading and long-term impacts on people globally, especially for Indigenous Peoples and local communities who are directly dependent on ecosystems, to meet basic needs. Increasing transboundary risks are projected across the food, energy and water sectors as impacts from weather and climate extremes propagate through supply-chains, markets, and natural resource flows and may interact with impacts from other crises such as pandemics. Risks also arise from some responses intended to reduce the risks of climate change, including risks from maladaptation and adverse side effects of some emissions reduction and carbon dioxide removal measures, such as afforestation of naturally unforested land or poorly implemented bioenergy compounding climate-related risks to biodiversity, food and water security, and livelihoods.

Text: Near-Term Risks  Many changes in the climate system, including extreme events, will become larger in the near term with increasing global warming. Multiple climatic and non-climatic risks will interact, resulting in increased compounding and cascading impacts becoming more difficult to manage. Losses and damages will increase with increasing global warming, while strongly concentrated among the poorest vulnerable populations. Continuing with current unsustainable development patterns would increase exposure and vulnerability of ecosystems and people to climate hazards. Global warming will continue to increase in the near term mainly due to increased cumulative CO 2 emissions in nearly all considered scenarios and pathways. In the near term, every region in the world is projected to face further increases in climate hazards , increasing multiple risks to ecosystems and humans. In the near term, natural variability will modulate human-caused changes, either attenuating or amplifying projected changes, especially at regional scales, with little effect on centennial global warming. Those modulations are important to consider in adaptation planning. Global surface temperature in any single year can vary above or below the long-term human-induced trend, due to natural variability. By 2030, global surface temperature in any individual year could exceed 1.5°C relative to 1850–1900 with a probability between 40% and 60%, across the five scenarios assessed in WGI. The occurrence of individual years with global surface temperature change above a certain level does not imply that this global warming level has been reached. If a large explosive volcanic eruption were to occur in the near term 150, it would temporarily and partially mask human-caused climate change by reducing global surface temperature and precipitation, especially over land, for one to three years.  The level of risk for humans and ecosystems will depend on near-term trends in vulnerability, exposure, level of socio-economic development and adaptation. In the near term, many climate-associated risks to natural and human systems depend more strongly on changes in these systems’ vulnerability and exposure than on differences in climate hazards between emissions scenarios . Future exposure to climatic hazards is increasing globally due to socio-economic development trends including growing inequality, and when urbanisation or migration increase exposure . Urbanisation increases hot extremes  and precipitation runoff intensity. Increasing urbanisation in low-lying and coastal zones will be a major driver of increasing exposure to extreme riverflow events and sea level rise hazards, increasing risks. Vulnerability will also rise rapidly in low-lying Small Island Developing States and atolls in the context of sea level rise . Human vulnerability will concentrate in informal settlements and rapidly growing smaller settlements; and vulnerability in rural areas will be heightened by reduced habitability and high reliance on climate-sensitive livelihoods. Human and ecosystem vulnerability are interdependent. Vulnerability to climate change for ecosystems will be strongly influenced by past, present, and future patterns of human development, including from unsustainable consumption and production, increasing demographic pressures, and persistent unsustainable use and management of land, ocean, and water. Several near-term risks can be moderated with adaptation.  Principal hazards and associated risks expected in the near term are: • Increased intensity and frequency of hot extremes and dangerous heat-humidity conditions, with increased human mortality, morbidity, and labour productivity loss.  • Increasing frequency of marine heatwaves will increase risks of biodiversity loss in the oceans, including from mass mortality events.  • Near-term risks for biodiversity loss are moderate to high in forest ecosystems and kelp and seagrass ecosystems and are high to very high in Arctic sea-ice and terrestrial ecosystems and warm-water coral reefs.  • More intense and frequent extreme rainfall and associated flooding in many regions including coastal and other low-lying cities , and increased proportion of and peak wind speeds of intense tropical cyclones.  • High risks from dryland water scarcity, wildfire damage, and permafrost degradation.  • Continued sea level rise and increased frequency and magnitude of extreme sea level events encroaching on coastal human settlements and damaging coastal infrastructure , committing low-lying coastal ecosystems to submergence and loss, expanding land salinization, with cascading to risks to livelihoods, health, well-being, cultural values, food and water security.  • Climate change will significantly increase ill health and premature deaths from the near to long term. Further warming will increase climate-sensitive food-borne, water-borne, and vector-borne disease risks, and mental health challenges including anxiety and stress.  Cryosphere-related changes in floods, landslides, and water availability have the potential to lead to severe consequences for people, infrastructure and the economy in most mountain regions .  • The projected increase in frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation will increase rain-generated local flooding.  Multiple climate change risks will increasingly compound and cascade in the near term. Many regions are projected to experience an increase in the probability of compound events with higher global warming including concurrent heatwaves and drought. Risks to health and food production will be made more severe from the interaction of sudden food production losses from heat and drought, exacerbated by heatinduced labour productivity losses. These interacting impacts will increase food prices, reduce household incomes, and lead to health risks of malnutrition and climate-related mortality with no or low levels of adaptation, especially in tropical regions . Concurrent and cascading risks from climate change to food systems, human settlements, infrastructure and health will make these risks more severe and more difficult to manage, including when interacting with non-climatic risk drivers such as competition for land between urban expansion and food production, and pandemics . Loss of ecosystems and their services has cascading and long-term impacts on people globally, especially for Indigenous Peoples and local communities who are directly dependent on ecosystems, to meet basic needs. Increasing transboundary risks are projected across the food, energy and water sectors as impacts from weather and climate extremes propagate through supply-chains, markets, and natural resource flows and may interact with impacts from other crises such as pandemics. Risks also arise from some responses intended to reduce the risks of climate change, including risks from maladaptation and adverse side effects of some emissions reduction and carbon dioxide removal measures, such as afforestation of naturally unforested land or poorly implemented bioenergy compounding climate-related risks to biodiversity, food and water security, and livelihoods.  With every increment of global warming losses and damages will increase, become increasingly difficult to avoid and be strongly concentrated among the poorest vulnerable populations. Adaptation does not prevent all losses and damages, even with effective adaptation and before reaching soft and hard limits. Losses and damages will be unequally distributed across systems, regions and sectors and are not comprehensively addressed by current financial, governance and institutional arrangements, particularly in vulnerable developing countries. .

Text: The Likelihood and Risks of Abrupt and Irreversible  Change The likelihood of abrupt and irreversible changes and their impacts increase with higher global warming levels. As warming levels increase, so do the risks of species extinction or irreversible loss of biodiversity in ecosystems such as forests , coral reefs and in Arctic regions . Risks associated with large-scale singular events or tipping points, such as ice sheet instability or ecosystem loss from tropical forests, transition to high risk between 1.5°C to 2.5°C  and to very high risk between 2.5°C to 4°C. The response of biogeochemical cycles to anthropogenic perturbations can be abrupt at regional scales and irreversible on decadal to century time scales. The probability of crossing uncertain regional thresholds increases with further warming.  Sea level rise is unavoidable for centuries to millennia due to continuing deep ocean warming and ice sheet melt, and sea levels will remain elevated for thousands of years . Global mean sea level rise will continue in the 21st century, with projected regional relative sea level rise within 20% of the global mean along two-thirds of the global coastline . The magnitude, the rate, the timing of threshold exceedances, and the long-term commitment of sea level rise depend on emissions, with higher emissions leading to greater and faster rates of sea level rise. Due to relative sea level rise, extreme sea level events that occurred once per century in the recent past are projected to occur at least annually at more than half of all tide gauge locations by 2100 and risks for coastal ecosystems, people and infrastructure will continue to increase beyond 2100. At sustained warming levels between 2°C and 3°C, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will be lost almost completely and irreversibly over multiple millennia. The probability and rate of ice mass loss increase with higher global surface temperatures. Over the next 2000 years, global mean sea level will rise by about 2 to 3 m if warming is limited to 1.5°C and 2 to 6 m if limited to 2°C . Projections of multi-millennial global mean sea level rise are consistent with reconstructed levels during past warm climate periods: global mean sea level was very likely 5 to 25 m higher than today roughly 3 million years ago, when global temperatures were 2.5°C to 4°C higher than 1850–1900. Further examples of unavoidable changes in the climate system due to multi-decadal or longer response timescales include continued glacier melt  and permafrost carbon loss.  The probability of low-likelihood outcomes associated with potentially very large impacts increases with higher global warming levels. Warming substantially above the assessed very likely range for a given scenario cannot be ruled out, and there is high confidence this would lead to regional changes greater than assessed in many aspects of the climate system. Low-likelihood, high-impact outcomes could occur at regional scales even for global warming within the very likely assessed range for a given GHG emissions scenario. Global mean sea level rise above the likely range – approaching 2 m by 2100 and in excess of 15 m by 2300 under a very high GHG emissions scenario  – cannot be ruled out due to deep uncertainty in ice-sheet processes 123 and would have severe impacts on populations in low elevation coastal zones. If global warming increases, some compound extreme events 124 will become more frequent, with higher likelihood of unprecedented intensities, durations or spatial extent. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is very likely to weaken over the 21st century for all considered scenarios, however an abrupt collapse is not expected before 2100 . If such a low probability event were to occur, it would very likely cause abrupt shifts in regional weather patterns and water cycle, such as a southward shift in the tropical rain belt, and large impacts on ecosystems and human activities. A sequence of large explosive volcanic eruptions within decades, as have occurred in the past, is a low-likelihood high-impact event that would lead to substantial cooling globally and regional climate perturbations over several decades.

The risks are higher for a global warming level of 1.5°C compared to the assessment in AR5, and become increasingly severe with every increment of global warming. Some specific risks include:  * Extinction risk for tens of thousands of species, especially in biodiversity hotspots, at a global warming level of 1.5°C. * Decline of coral reefs by 70-90% at 1.5°C. * Loss of mass or disappearance of many low-elevation and small glaciers within decades to centuries. * Increased risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth. * Decline in snowmelt water availability for irrigation in some regions. * Increased risks to cities, settlements, and key infrastructure. * Extinction risk for endemic species in biodiversity hotspots increasing tenfold if warming rises from 1.5°C to 3°C. * Projected increases in direct flood damages at 2°C and 3°C. * Local extinction of ~50% of tropical marine species and biome shifts across 35% of global land area at 4°C of warming. * Increased global burned area and fire frequency at 4°C of warming. * Adverse impacts and related losses and damages from climate change escalating with every increment of global warming. * Interaction of multiple climatic and non-climatic risk drivers, resulting in compounding overall risk and risks cascading across sectors and regions. * Risks from some responses intended to reduce climate change risks, such as adverse side effects of emission reduction and carbon dioxide removal measures. * Uncertainties and knowledge gaps associated with Solar Radiation Modification (SRM) approaches to reduce climate change risks. * Lack of robust and formal SRM governance posing risks.

Text: The text discusses the decreasing effectiveness of adaptation options as global warming increases. Adaptation limits will be reached, leading to increased losses and damages, particularly for the most vulnerable populations. Integrated, cross-cutting solutions increase the effectiveness of adaptation. However, maladaptation can occur, leading to lock-ins of vulnerability and exposure. Some specific adaptation options, such as agriculture, water management, and ecosystem-based adaptation, become less effective at higher warming levels. Sea level rise poses a unique adaptation challenge, requiring a combination of protection, accommodation, advance, and planned relocation strategies. Ecosystem-based solutions, such as wetlands, provide co-benefits but have physical limits and can be maladaptive if not part of a long-term adaptive plan. Overall, effective adaptation requires long-term planning, flexibility, and inclusivity to avoid maladaptation and its consequences.</s>  The text emphasizes the urgency and importance of near-term climate action to limit global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C and the decreasing effectiveness of adaptation with increasing warming. The text also highlights that societal choices and actions in this decade will determine the extent of climate resilient development. The text provides projections for global GHG emissions reductions in different warming scenarios and sectors, and emphasizes the need for reductions in both CO2 and non-CO2 emissions. The text also mentions the importance of rapid, deep, and sustained mitigation and accelerated adaptation actions to avoid losses and damages, with disproportionate impacts on vulnerable populations. The text also mentions the importance of reducing emissions from various sectors, with land-use, land-use change and forestry, and energy supply sectors reaching net zero CO2 emissions earlier than buildings, industry, and transport sectors. The text also mentions that continued investments in high-emitting infrastructure and limited development and deployment of low-emitting alternatives prior to 2030 will act as barriers to accelerated emission reductions during 2030-2050.</s>  The text emphasizes the importance of accelerating both adaptation and mitigation actions to reduce losses and damages associated with climate change, particularly for vulnerable populations. The benefits of limiting global warming to close to 1.5°C include substantial reductions in projected losses and damages, improved air quality, and co-benefits for sustainable development. However, delayed mitigation action can decrease the effectiveness of many adaptation options and increase the risk of stranded assets.  The text also highlights the need for comprehensive, effective, and innovative responses that integrate adaptation and mitigation to harness synergies and reduce trade-offs. Mitigation actions have co-benefits, such as improving air quality and human health, and reducing methane emissions. However, there are challenges associated with delayed adaptation and mitigation actions, including the risk of cost escalation, lock-in of infrastructure, and reduced feasibility and effectiveness of options.  Scaling-up near-term climate actions requires a mix of low-cost and high-cost options, with high-cost options needed to avoid future lock-ins and foster innovation. Climate resilient development pathways are shaped by equity and social and climate justice, and embedding effective and equitable adaptation and mitigation in development planning can reduce vulnerability and enable climate resilient development.  Enabling conditions and reducing barriers to feasibility are necessary to realize opportunities for deep and rapid adaptation and mitigation actions and climate resilient development. These enabling conditions include equity and inclusion in climate action, rapid and far-reaching transitions in sectors and systems, measures to achieve synergies and reduce tradeoffs with sustainable development goals, governance and policy improvements, access to finance, improved international cooperation and technology improvements, and integration of near-term actions across sectors, systems, and regions.

The text highlights the importance of integrated, cross-cutting solutions and the risks of maladaptation. Some specific adaptation options, such as agriculture, water management, and ecosystem-based adaptation, become less effective at higher warming levels. Sea level rise poses a unique adaptation challenge, requiring a combination of protection, accommodation, advance, and planned relocation strategies. Ecosystem-based solutions provide co-benefits but have physical limits and can be maladaptive if not part of a long-term adaptive plan. Effective adaptation requires long-term planning, flexibility, and inclusivity.

The text also emphasizes the importance of accelerating both adaptation and mitigation actions to reduce losses and damages associated with climate change. Limiting global warming to close to 1.5°C or 2°C has substantial benefits, including reduced losses and damages, improved air quality, and co-benefits for sustainable development. Delayed mitigation action can decrease the effectiveness of many adaptation options and increase the risk of stranded assets.

The text highlights the need for comprehensive, effective, and innovative responses that integrate adaptation and mitigation to harness synergies and reduce trade-offs. Mitigation actions have co-benefits, such as improving air quality and human health, and reducing methane emissions. However, there are challenges associated with delayed adaptation and mitigation actions, including the risk of cost escalation, lock-in of infrastructure, and reduced feasibility and effectiveness of options.

Scaling-up near-term climate actions requires a mix of low-cost and high-cost options, with high-cost options needed to avoid future lock-ins and foster innovation. Climate resilient development pathways are shaped by equity and social and climate justice, and embedding effective and equitable adaptation and mitigation in development planning can reduce vulnerability and enable climate resilient development.

Enabling conditions and reducing barriers to feasibility are necessary to realize opportunities for deep and rapid adaptation and mitigation actions and climate resilient development. These enabling conditions include equity and inclusion in climate action, rapid and far-reaching transitions in sectors and systems, measures to achieve synergies and reduce tradeoffs with sustainable development goals, governance and policy improvements, access to finance, improved international cooperation and technology improvements, and integration of near-term actions across sectors, systems, and regions.

Barriers to feasibility and effectiveness of responses can be overcome by addressing a range of barriers, including economic, technological, institutional, social, environmental, and geophysical barriers.

Text: Adaptation Gaps and Barriers  Despite progress, adaptation gaps exist between current levels of adaptation and levels needed to respond to impacts and reduce climate risks. While progress in adaptation implementation is observed across all sectors and regions , many adaptation initiatives prioritise immediate and near-term climate risk reduction, e.g., through hard flood protection, which reduces the opportunity for transformational adaptation . Most observed adaptation is fragmented, small in scale, incremental, sector-specific, and focused more on planning rather than implementation. Further, observed adaptation is unequally distributed across regions and the largest adaptation gaps exist among lower population income groups. In the urban context, the largest adaptation gaps exist in projects that manage complex risks, for example in the food–energy–water–health nexus or the inter-relationships of air quality and climate risk. Many funding, knowledge and practice gaps remain for effective implementation, monitoring and evaluation and current adaptation efforts are not expected to meet existing goals. At current rates of adaptation planning and implementation the adaptation gap will continue to grow.  Soft and hard adaptation limits 100 have already been reached in some sectors and regions, in spite of adaptation having buffered some climate impacts. Ecosystems already reaching hard adaptation limits include some warm water coral reefs, some coastal wetlands, some rainforests, and some polar and mountain ecosystems. Individuals and households in low lying coastal areas in Australasia and Small Islands and smallholder farmers in Central and South America, Africa, Europe and Asia have reached soft limits, resulting from financial, governance, institutional and policy constraints and can be overcome by addressing these constraints. Transitioning from incremental to transformational adaptation can help overcome soft adaptation limits .  Adaptation does not prevent all losses and damages, even with effective adaptation and before reaching soft and hard limits. Losses and damages are unequally distributed across systems, regions and sectors and are not comprehensively addressed by current financial, governance and institutional arrangements, particularly in vulnerable developing countries.  There is increased evidence of maladaptation in various sectors and regions. Examples of maladaptation are observed in urban areas , agriculture , ecosystems (e.g. fire suppression in naturally Long-term Adaptation Options and Limits  With increasing warming, adaptation options will become more constrained and less effective. At higher levels of warming, losses and damages will increase, and additional human and natural systems will reach adaptation limits. Integrated, cross-cutting multi-sectoral solutions increase the effectiveness of adaptation. Maladaptation can create lock-ins of vulnerability, exposure and risks but can be avoided by long-term planning and the implementation of adaptation actions that are flexible, multi-sectoral and inclusive. The effectiveness of adaptation to reduce climate risk is documented for specific contexts, sectors and regions and will decrease with increasing warming 125 . For example, common adaptation responses in agriculture – adopting improved cultivars and agronomic practices, and changes in cropping patterns and crop systems – will become less effective from 2°C to higher levels of warming. The effectiveness of most water-related adaptation options to reduce projected risks declines with increasing warming. Adaptations for hydropower and thermo-electric power generation are effective in most regions up to 1.5°C to 2°C, with decreasing effectiveness at higher levels of warming . Ecosystem-based Adaptation is vulnerable to climate change impacts, with effectiveness declining with increasing global warming. Globally, adaptation options related to agroforestry and forestry have a sharp decline in effectiveness at 3°C, with a substantial increase in residual risk.  With increasing global warming, more limits to adaptation will be reached and losses and damages, strongly concentrated among the poorest vulnerable populations, will increase. Already below 1.5°C, autonomous and evolutionary adaptation responses by terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems will increasingly face hard limits. Above 1.5°C, some ecosystem-based adaptation measures will lose their effectiveness in providing benefits to people as these ecosystems will reach hard adaptation limits. Adaptation to address the risks of heat stress, heat mortality and reduced capacities for outdoor work for humans face soft and hard limits across regions that become significantly more severe at 1.5°C, and are particularly relevant for regions with warm climates. Above 1.5°C global warming level, limited freshwater resources pose potential hard limits for small islands and for regions dependent on glacier and snow melt . By 2°C, soft limits are projected for multiple staple crops, particularly in tropical regions. By 3°C, soft limits are projected for some water management measures for many regions, with hard limits projected for parts of Europe .  Integrated, cross-cutting multi-sectoral solutions increase the effectiveness of adaptation. For example, inclusive, integrated and long-term planning at local, municipal, sub-national and national scales, together with effective regulation and monitoring systems and financial and technological resources and capabilities foster urban and rural system transition. There are a range of cross-cutting adaptation options, such as disaster risk management, early warning systems, climate services and risk spreading and sharing that have broad applicability across sectors and provide greater benefits to other adaptation options when combined. Transitioning from incremental to transformational adaptation, and addressing a range of constraints, primarily in the financial, governance, institutional and policy domains, can help overcome soft adaptation limits. However, adaptation does not prevent all losses and damages, even with effective adaptation and before reaching soft and hard limits.  Maladaptive responses to climate change can create lock-ins of vulnerability, exposure and risks that are difficult and expensive to change and exacerbate existing inequalities. Actions that focus on sectors and risks in isolation and on short-term gains often lead to maladaptation. Adaptation options can become maladaptive due to their environmental impacts that constrain ecosystem services and decrease biodiversity and ecosystem resilience to climate change or by causing adverse outcomes for different groups, exacerbating inequity. Maladaptation can be avoided by flexible, multi-sectoral, inclusive and long-term planning and implementation of adaptation actions with benefits to many sectors and systems.  Sea level rise poses a distinctive and severe adaptation challenge as it implies both dealing with slow onset changes and increases in the frequency and magnitude of extreme sea level events . Such adaptation challenges would occur much earlier under high rates of sea level rise. Responses to ongoing sea level rise and land subsidence include protection, accommodation, advance and planned relocation. These responses are more effective if combined and/or sequenced, planned well ahead, aligned with sociocultural values and underpinned by inclusive community engagement processes. Ecosystem-based solutions such as wetlands provide co-benefits for the environment and climate mitigation, and reduce costs for flood defences , but have site-specific physical limits, at least above 1.5ºC of global warming and lose effectiveness at high rates of sea level rise beyond 0.5 to 1 cm yr -1. Seawalls can be maladaptive as they effectively reduce impacts in the short term but can also result in lock-ins and increase exposure to climate risks in the long term unless they are integrated into a long-term adaptive plan.

Text: The text emphasizes the importance of limiting CO2 emissions to prevent long-term climate change and its consequences. The IPCC assessment shows that the likely range of equilibrium climate sensitivity is narrower than in previous assessments, and future warming depends on future GHG emissions. The best estimates and likely ranges of warming for 2081-2100 vary from 1.4°C to 4.4°C, depending on the GHG emissions scenario. Deep, rapid, and sustained GHG emissions reductions are necessary to limit warming to 1.5°C or less than 2°C by the end of the century. Global warming will continue to increase in the near term, and improvements in air quality and reductions in air pollutant emissions can be achieved through combined climate change mitigation and air pollution control policies. Changes in short-lived climate forcers can lead to additional net warming or cooling, depending on the scenario. Continued GHG emissions will further affect all major climate system components, and many changes will be irreversible on centennial to millennial time scales. The text also highlights the projected regional changes, including more frequent and intense temperature extremes, heavy precipitation and flooding events, and agricultural and ecological droughts.</s>  The text discusses the concept of carbon budgets and the importance of limiting cumulative net CO2 emissions to avoid exceeding a certain temperature threshold. The best estimates suggest that to limit warming to 1.5°C with a 50% likelihood, the remaining carbon budget is approximately 500 GtCO2, while for 2°C it is 1150 GtCO2. These estimates take into account various factors such as the transient climate response (TCR), historical warming, climate system feedbacks, and non-CO2 emissions. The stronger the reductions in non-CO2 emissions, the lower the resulting temperatures for a given carbon budget or the larger the carbon budget for the same level of temperature change. If annual CO2 emissions between 2020-2030 remain at the same level as 2019, the remaining carbon budget for 1.5°C would almost be exhausted, and more than a third of the remaining carbon budget for 2°C would be used up. Historical cumulative net CO2 emissions between 1850 and 2019 amount to about four-fifths of the total carbon budget for a 50% probability of limiting global warming to 1.5°C and about two-thirds of the total carbon budget for a 67% probability to limit global warming to 2°C. The text also mentions that natural carbon sinks, such as land and oceans, become less effective at absorbing CO2 as cumulative net CO2 emissions increase, and additional ecosystem responses to warming, such as GHG fluxes from wetlands, permafrost thaw, and wildfires, would further increase atmospheric CO2 concentrations. In scenarios where CO2 concentrations peak and decline during the 21st century, the land and ocean begin to take up less carbon and turn into a weak net source by 2100 in very low GHG emissions scenarios.</s>  The text emphasizes the importance of limiting human-caused global warming by reducing cumulative CO2 emissions and achieving net zero or net negative CO2 emissions, along with strong reductions of other greenhouse gases (GHGs). Reaching net zero CO2 emissions requires carbon dioxide removal to achieve net negative CO2 emissions and stabilize CO2-induced global surface temperature increase. Achieving net zero GHG emissions, where metric-weighted anthropogenic GHG emissions equal CO2 removal, is different from net zero CO2 emissions. The timing of net zero CO2 emissions, followed by net zero GHG emissions, depends on the desired climate outcome, mitigation strategy, and gases covered. Global net zero CO2 emissions are reached in the early 2050s for a 1.5°C warming limit with no overshoot, and around the early 2070s for a 2°C warming limit. Non-CO2 GHG emissions are strongly reduced in all pathways, but residual emissions of CH4, N2O, and F-gases remain at about 8-11 GtCO2-eq yr-1 at the time of net zero GHG emissions, making net zero CO2 emissions necessary before net zero GHG emissions.</s>  The text discusses the need for rapid and deep emissions reductions across all sectors to limit global warming to 2°C or lower by 2100. This can be achieved through energy efficiency, low-GHG technologies, and socio-cultural options. Transitioning from fossil fuels to zero-carbon energy sources, such as renewables or fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage, is essential. In 2050, almost all electricity will come from zero or low-carbon sources. Land-based mitigation and land-use change, including reforestation, afforestation, reduced deforestation, and bioenergy, are also crucial. Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) methods, such as afforestation, reforestation, improved forest management, agroforestry, and soil carbon sequestration, can deliver large-scale GHG emission reductions and enhanced CO2 removal. CDR can also lower net CO2 or net GHG emissions in the near term, counterbalance residual emissions, and achieve net negative CO2 or GHG emissions. The maturity, removal process, time scale of carbon storage, storage medium, mitigation potential, cost, co-benefits, impacts, and risks of CDR methods vary. Currently, afforestation, reforestation, improved forest management, agroforestry, and soil carbon sequestration are the only widely practiced CDR methods. The deployment of CDR methods in global mitigation pathways depends on assumptions about costs, availability, and constraints.</s>  [/INST]","The text emphasizes the importance of limiting CO2 emissions to prevent long-term climate change and its consequences.

Text: The Gap Between Mitigation Policies, Pledges and  Pathways that Limit Warming to 1.5°C or Below 2°C Global GHG emissions in 2030 associated with the implementation of NDCs announced prior to COP2691 would make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5°C during the 21st century and would make it harder to limit warming below 2°C – if no additional commitments are made or actions taken. A substantial ‘emissions gap’ exists as global GHG emissions in 2030 associated with the implementation of NDCs announced prior to COP26 would be similar to or only slightly below 2019 emission levels and higher than those associated with modelled mitigation pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot or to 2°C, assuming immediate action, which implies deep, rapid, and sustained global GHG emission reductions this decade  . 92 The magnitude of the emissions gap depends on the global warming level considered and whether only unconditional or also conditional elements of NDCs 93 are considered . Modelled pathways that are consistent with NDCs announced prior to COP26 until 2030 and assume no increase in ambition thereafter have higher emissions, leading to a median global warming of 2.8 [2.1 to 3.4]°C by 2100 . If the ‘emission gap’ is not reduced, global GHG emissions in 2030 consistent with NDCs announced prior to COP26 make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5°C during the 21st century, while limiting warming to 2°C would imply an unprecedented acceleration of mitigation efforts during 2030–2050 .  Policies implemented by the end of 2020 are projected to result in higher global GHG emissions in 2030 than those implied by NDCs, indicating an ‘implementation gap 94 ’ . Projected global emissions implied by policies implemented by the end of 2020 are 57 GtCO2 -eq in 2030. This points to an implementation gap compared with the NDCs of 4 to 7 GtCO 2-eq in 2030; without a strengthening of policies, emissions are projected to rise, leading to a median global warming of 2.2°C to 3.5°C by 2100 .  Projected cumulative future CO2 emissions over the lifetime of existing fossil fuel infrastructure without additional abatement exceed the total cumulative net CO2 emissions in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot. They are approximately equal to total cumulative net CO2 emissions in pathways that limit warming to 2°C with a likelihood of 83% 96. Limiting warming to 2°C or lower will result in stranded assets. About 80% of coal, 50% of gas, and 30% of oil reserves cannot be burned and emitted if warming is limited to 2°C. Significantly more reserves are expected to remain unburned if warming is limited to 1.5°C.  Many countries have signalled an intention to achieve net zero GHG or net zero CO 2 emissions by around mid-century . More than 100 countries have either adopted, announced or are discussing net zero GHG or net zero CO 2 emissions commitments, covering more than two-thirds of global GHG emissions. A growing number of cities are setting climate targets, including net zero GHG targets. Many companies and institutions have also announced net zero emissions targets in recent years. The various net zero emission pledges differ across countries in terms of scope and specificity, and limited policies are to date in place to deliver on them.  All mitigation strategies face implementation challenges, including technology risks, scaling, and costs. Almost all mitigation options also face institutional barriers that need to be addressed to enable their application at scale . Current development pathways may create behavioural, spatial, economic and social barriers to accelerated mitigation at all scales. Choices made by policymakers, citizens, the private sector and other stakeholders influence societies’ development pathways. Structural factors of national circumstances and capabilities  affect the breadth and depth of climate governance. The extent to which civil society actors, political actors, businesses, youth, labour, media, Indigenous Peoples, and local communities are engaged influences political support for climate change mitigation and eventual policy outcomes.  The adoption of low-emission technologies lags in most developing countries, particularly least developed ones, due in part to weaker enabling conditions, including limited finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity . In many countries, especially those with limited institutional capacity, several adverse side-effects have been observed as a result of diffusion of low-emission technology, e.g., low-value employment, and dependency on foreign knowledge and suppliers. Low-emission innovation along with strengthened enabling conditions can reinforce development benefits, which can, in turn, create feedbacks towards greater public support for policy. Persistent and region-specific barriers also continue to hamper the economic and political feasibility of deploying AFOLU mitigation options. Barriers to implementation of AFOLU mitigation include insufficient institutional and financial support, uncertainty over long-term additionality and trade-offs, weak governance, insecure land ownership, low incomes and the lack of access to alternative sources of income, and the risk of reversal . Remaining Carbon Budgets  Limiting global temperature increase to a specific level requires limiting cumulative net CO2 emissions to within a finite carbon budget , along with strong reductions in other GHGs. For every 1000 GtCO2 emitted by human activity, global mean temperature rises by likely 0.27°C to 0.63°C. This relationship implies that there is a finite carbon budget that cannot be exceeded in order to limit warming to any given level.  The best estimates of the remaining carbon budget from the beginning of 2020 for limiting warming to 1.5°C with a 50% likelihood is estimated to be 500 GtCO2; for 2°C this is 1150 GtCO2.128 Remaining carbon budgets have been quantified based on the assessed value of TCRE and its uncertainty, estimates of historical warming, climate system feedbacks such as emissions from thawing permafrost, and the global surface temperature change after global anthropogenic CO 2 emissions reach net zero, as well as variations in projected warming from non-CO2 emissions due in part to mitigation action. The stronger the reductions in non-CO2 emissions the lower the resulting temperatures are for a given RCB or the larger RCB for the same level of temperature change. For instance, the RCB for limiting warming to 1.5°C with a 50% likelihood could vary between 300 to 600 GtCO 2 depending on non-CO 2 warming 129 . Limiting warming to 2°C with a 67% likelihood would imply a RCB of 1150 GtCO2 from the beginning of 2020. To stay below 2°C with a 50% likelihood, the RCB is higher, i.e., 1350 GtCO 2 If the annual CO2 emissions between 2020–2030 stayed, on average, at the same level as 2019, the resulting cumulative emissions would almost exhaust the remaining carbon budget for 1.5°C, and exhaust more than a third of the remaining carbon budget for 2°C . Based on central estimates only, historical cumulative net CO2 emissions between 1850 and 2019 amount to about four-fifths of the total carbon budget for a 50% probability of limiting global warming to 1.5°C and to about two-thirds of the total carbon budget for a 67% probability to limit global warming to 2°C.  In scenarios with increasing CO 2 emissions, the land and ocean carbon sinks are projected to be less effective at slowing the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere. While natural land and ocean carbon sinks are projected to take up, in absolute terms, a progressively larger amount of CO 2 under higher compared to lower CO2 emissions scenarios, they become less effective, that is, the proportion of emissions taken up by land and ocean decreases with increasing cumulative net CO2 emissions. Additional ecosystem responses to warming not yet fully included in climate models, such as GHG fluxes from wetlands, permafrost thaw, and wildfires, would further increase concentrations of these gases in the atmosphere . In scenarios where CO2 concentrations peak and decline during the 21st century, the land and ocean begin to take up less carbon in response to declining atmospheric CO2 concentrations  and turn into a weak net source by 2100 in the very low GHG emissions scenario 133. [/INST]","The text discusses the gap between countries' announced emissions reduction targets (NDCs) and actual emissions pathways, which could lead to global warming exceeding 1.5°C or 2°C during the 21st century. The text highlights that the emissions gap is significant, and the implementation of current policies would result in higher emissions in 2030 than those implied by NDCs. The text also mentions that limiting warming to 1.5°C or 2°C will require deep, rapid, and sustained global emissions reductions this decade. Additionally, the text discusses the concept of remaining carbon budgets, which refers to the amount of CO2 that can be emitted to limit warming to a specific level. The text also mentions that the adoption of low-emission technologies faces implementation challenges, including institutional barriers and adverse side-effects. The text also mentions that many countries have net zero emissions targets, but limited policies are in place to deliver on them. The text also mentions that limiting warming to 2°C or lower will result in stranded assets, and that remaining carbon budgets have been quantified based on various factors, including historical warming, climate system feedbacks, and non-CO2 emissions. The text also mentions that natural carbon sinks, such as forests and oceans, become less effective at absorbing CO2 as emissions increase, and that additional ecosystem responses to warming could further increase concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</s>","0.9618785581519339","0.8361949526598973","0.96309626415892","0.9655356458958844","0.9316763552166589","42.796849489212036"

Text: Net Zero Emissions: Timing and Implications  From a physical science perspective, limiting human-caused global warming to a specific level requires limiting cumulative CO2 emissions, reaching net zero or net negative CO2 emissions, along with strong reductions of other GHG emissions . Global modelled pathways that reach and sustain net zero GHG emissions are projected to result in a gradual decline in surface temperature. Reaching net zero GHG emissions primarily requires deep reductions in CO2, methane, and other GHG emissions, and implies net negative CO2 emissions.134 Carbon dioxide removal will be necessary to achieve net negative CO2 emissions 135. Achieving global net zero CO2 emissions, with remaining anthropogenic CO 2 emissions balanced by durably stored CO 2 from anthropogenic removal, is a requirement to stabilise CO2-induced global surface temperature increase . This is different from achieving net zero GHG emissions, where metric-weighted anthropogenic GHG emissions  equal CO 2 removal. Emissions pathways that reach and sustain net zero GHG emissions defined by the 100-year global warming potential imply net negative CO2 emissions and are projected to result in a gradual decline in surface temperature after an earlier peak. While reaching net zero CO2 or net zero GHG emissions requires deep and rapid reductions in gross emissions, the deployment of CDR to counterbalance hardto-abate residual emissions  is unavoidable .  In modelled pathways, the timing of net zero CO2 emissions, followed by net zero GHG emissions, depends on several variables, including the desired climate outcome, the mitigation strategy and the gases covered. Global net zero CO2 emissions are reached in the early 2050s in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, and around the early 2070s in pathways that limit warming to 2°C. While non-CO2 GHG emissions are strongly reduced in all pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower, residual emissions of CH4 and N2O and F-gases of about 8 [5–11] GtCO2 -eq yr -1 remain at the time of net zero GHG, counterbalanced by net negative CO2 emissions. As a result, net zero CO2 would be reached before net zero GHGs . Overshoot Pathways: Increased Risks and Other  Implications Exceeding a specific remaining carbon budget results in higher global warming. Achieving and sustaining net negative global CO 2 emissions could reverse the resulting temperature exceedance. Continued reductions in emissions of short-lived climate forcers, particularly methane, after peak temperature has been reached, would also further reduce warming. Only a small number of the most ambitious global modelled pathways limit global warming to 1.5°C without overshoot.  Overshoot of a warming level results in more adverse impacts, some irreversible, and additional risks for human and natural systems compared to staying below that warming level, with risks growing with the magnitude and duration of overshoot. Compared to pathways without overshoot, societies and ecosystems would be exposed to greater and more widespread changes in climatic impact-drivers, such as extreme heat and extreme precipitation, with increasing risks to infrastructure, low-lying coastal settlements, and associated livelihoods. Overshooting 1.5°C will result in irreversible adverse impacts on certain ecosystems with low resilience, such as polar, mountain, and coastal ecosystems, impacted by ice-sheet melt, glacier melt, or by accelerating and higher committed sea level rise. Overshoot increases the risks of severe impacts, such as increased wildfires, mass mortality of trees, drying of peatlands, thawing of permafrost and weakening natural land carbon sinks; such impacts could increase releases of GHGs making temperature reversal more challenging.  The larger the overshoot, the more net negative CO2 emissions needed to return to a given warming level. Reducing global temperature by removing CO 2 would require net negative emissions of 220 GtCO 2 for every tenth of a degree. Modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot reach median values of cumulative net negative emissions of 220 GtCO2 by 2100, pathways that return warming to 1.5°C after high overshoot reach median values of 360 GtCO2. 137 More rapid reduction in CO 2 and non-CO2 emissions, particularly methane, limits peak warming levels and reduces the requirement for net negative CO2 emissions and CDR, thereby reducing feasibility and sustainability concerns, and social and environmental risks . The Timing and Urgency of Climate Action  The magnitude and rate of climate change and associated risks depend strongly on near-term mitigation and adaptation actions . Global warming is more likely than not to reach 1.5°C between 2021 and 2040 even under the very low GHG emission scenarios, and likely or very likely to exceed 1.5°C under higher emissions scenarios 141. Many adaptation options have medium or high feasibility up to 1.5°C , but hard limits to adaptation have already been reached in some ecosystems and the effectiveness of adaptation to reduce climate risk will decrease with increasing warming. Societal choices and actions implemented in this decade determine the extent to which medium- and long-term pathways will deliver higher or lower climate resilient development. Climate resilient development prospects are increasingly limited if current greenhouse gas emissions do not rapidly decline, especially if 1.5°C global warming is exceeded in the near term. Without urgent, effective and equitable adaptation and mitigation actions, climate change increasingly threatens the health and livelihoods of people around the globe, ecosystem health, and biodiversity, with severe adverse consequences for current and future generations. .  In modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot and in those that limit warming to 2°C, assuming immediate actions, global GHG emissions are projected to peak in the early 2020s followed by rapid and deep GHG emissions reductions 142 . In pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, net global GHG emissions are projected to fall by 43 [34 to 60]%143 below 2019 levels by 2030, 60 [49 to 77]% by 2035, 69 [58 to 90]% by 2040 and 84 [73 to 98]% by 2050 144. Global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C have reductions in GHG emissions below 2019 levels of 21 [1 to 42]% by 2030, 35 [22 to 55] % by 2035, 46 [34 to 63] % by 2040 and 64 [53 to 77]% by 2050145. Global GHG emissions associated with NDCs announced prior to COP26 would make it likely that warming would exceed 1.5°C and limiting warming to 2°C would then imply a rapid acceleration of emission reductions during 2030–2050, around 70% faster than in pathways where immediate action is taken to limit warming to 2°C Continued investments in unabated high-emitting infrastructure and limited development and deployment of low-emitting alternatives prior to 2030 would act as barriers to this acceleration and increase feasibility risks.  All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 involve reductions in both net CO 2 emissions and non-CO 2 emissions. For example, in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, global CH4 emissions are reduced by 34 [21 to 57]% below 2019 levels by 2030 and by 44 [31 to 63]% in 2040. Global CH 4 emissions are reduced by 24 [9 to 53]% below 2019 levels by 2030 and by 37 [20 to 60]% in 2040 in modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C with action starting in 2020.  All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 involve GHG emission reductions in all sectors . The contributions of different sectors vary across modelled mitigation pathways. In most global modelled mitigation pathways, emissions from land-use, land-use change and forestry, via reforestation and reduced deforestation, and from the energy supply sector reach net zero CO2 emissions earlier than the buildings, industry and transport sectors. Strategies can rely on combinations of different options, but doing less in one sector needs to be compensated by further reductions in other sectors if warming is to be limited.  Without rapid, deep and sustained mitigation and accelerated adaptation actions, losses and damages will continue to increase, including projected adverse impacts in Africa, LDCs, SIDS, Central and South America , Asia and the Arctic, and will disproportionately affect the most vulnerable populations .

Global warming can be kept below specific levels by limiting cumulative CO2 emissions and reducing other greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Net zero CO2 emissions are projected to result in a gradual decline in surface temperature, while net negative CO2 emissions are necessary to achieve this goal.

The text also discusses the implications of overshooting a specific warming level, which can result in more adverse impacts and additional risks for human and natural systems. The larger the overshoot, the more net negative CO2 emissions will be required to return to a given warming level.

Sectoral Contributions to Mitigation  All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 involve rapid and deep and in most cases immediate GHG emissions reductions in all sectors. Reductions in GHG emissions in industry, transport, buildings, and urban areas can be achieved through a combination of energy efficiency and conservation and a transition to low-GHG technologies and energy carriers. Socio-cultural options and behavioural change can reduce global GHG emissions of end-use sectors, with most of the potential in developed countries, if combined with improved infrastructure design and access.  Global modelled mitigation pathways reaching net zero CO2 and GHG emissions include transitioning from fossil fuels without carbon capture and storage to very low- or zero-carbon energy sources, such as renewables or fossil fuels with CCS, demand-side measures and improving efficiency, reducing non-CO2 GHG emissions, and CDR 136. In global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or below, almost all electricity is supplied from zero or low-carbon sources in 2050, such as renewables or fossil fuels with CO2 capture and storage, combined with increased electrification of energy demand. Such pathways meet energy service demand with relatively low energy use, through e.g., enhanced energy efficiency and behavioural changes and increased electrification of energy end use. Modelled global pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot generally implement such changes faster than pathways limiting global warming to 2°C.  AFOLU mitigation options, when sustainably implemented, can deliver large-scale GHG emission reductions and enhanced CO2 removal; however, barriers to implementation and trade-offs may result from the impacts of climate change, competing demands on land, conflicts with food security and livelihoods, the complexity of land ownership and management systems, and cultural aspects. All assessed modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 include land-based mitigation and land-use change, with most including different combinations of reforestation, afforestation, reduced deforestation, and bioenergy. However, accumulated carbon in vegetation and soils is at risk from future loss triggered by climate change and disturbances such as flood, drought, fire, or pest outbreaks, or future poor management.  In addition to deep, rapid, and sustained emission reductions, CDR can fulfil three complementary roles: lowering net CO2 or net GHG emissions in the near term; counterbalancing ‘hard-to-abate’ residual emissions  to help reach net zero CO2 or GHG emissions, and achieving net negative CO 2 or GHG emissions if deployed at levels exceeding annual residual emissions. CDR methods vary in terms of their maturity, removal process, time scale of carbon storage, storage medium, mitigation potential, cost, co-benefits, impacts and risks, and governance requirements. Specifically, maturity ranges from lower maturity to higher maturity; removal and storage potential ranges from lower potential to higher potential; costs range from lower cost to higher cost  .

Text: Synergies and trade-offs, costs and benefits  Mitigation and adaptation options can lead to synergies and trade-offs with other aspects of sustainable development . Synergies and trade-offs depend on the pace and magnitude of changes and the development context including inequalities, with consideration of climate justice. The potential or effectiveness of some adaptation and mitigation options decreases as climate change intensifies .  In the energy sector, transitions to low-emission systems will have multiple co-benefits, including improvements in air quality and health. There are potential synergies between sustainable development and, for instance, energy efficiency and renewable energy.  For agriculture, land, and food systems, many land management options and demand-side response options  can contribute to eradicating poverty and eliminating hunger while promoting good health and well-being, clean water and sanitation, and life on land . In contrast, certain adaptation options that promote intensification of production, such as irrigation, may have negative effects on sustainability  .  Reforestation, improved forest management, soil carbon sequestration, peatland restoration and coastal blue carbon management are examples of CDR methods that can enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functions, employment and local livelihoods, depending on context . However, afforestation or production of biomass crops for bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage or biochar can have adverse socio-economic and environmental impacts, including on biodiversity, food and water security, local livelihoods and the rights of Indigenous Peoples, especially if implemented at large scales and where land tenure is insecure.  Modelled pathways that assume using resources more efficiently or shift global development towards sustainability include fewer challenges, such as dependence on CDR and pressure on land and biodiversity, and have the most pronounced synergies with respect to sustainable development .  Strengthening climate change mitigation action entails more rapid transitions and higher up-front investments, but brings benefits from avoiding damages from climate change and reduced adaptation costs. The aggregate effects of climate change mitigation on global GDP  are small compared to global projected GDP growth. Projected estimates of global aggregate net economic damages and the costs of adaptation generally increase with global warming level.  Cost-benefit analysis remains limited in its ability to represent all damages from climate change, including non-monetary damages, or to capture the heterogeneous nature of damages and the risk of catastrophic damages. Even without accounting for these factors or for the co-benefits of mitigation, the global benefits of limiting warming to 2°C exceed the cost of mitigation . This finding is robust against a wide range of assumptions about social preferences on inequalities and discounting over time . Limiting global warming to 1.5°C instead of 2°C would increase the costs of mitigation, but also increase the benefits in terms of reduced impacts and related risks and reduced adaptation needs 140.  Considering other sustainable development dimensions, such as the potentially strong economic benefits on human health from air quality improvement, may enhance the estimated benefits of mitigation . The economic effects of strengthened mitigation action vary across regions and countries, depending notably on economic structure, regional emissions reductions, policy design and level of international cooperation. Ambitious mitigation pathways imply large and sometimes disruptive changes in economic structure, with implications for near-term actions, equity , sustainability, and finance .

The effectiveness of some mitigation and adaptation options decreases as climate change intensifies. In the energy sector, transitions to low-emission systems have co-benefits such as air quality improvements and potential synergies with sustainable development. For agriculture, land management options and demand-side response can contribute to sustainable development, but some adaptation options may have negative effects. Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) methods like reforestation and improved forest management can enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functions, but large-scale afforestation or production of biomass crops for bioenergy can have adverse socio-economic and environmental impacts. Modelled pathways towards sustainability have fewer challenges and more pronounced synergies. The benefits of limiting warming to 2°C exceed the costs of mitigation, and the benefits increase when limiting warming to 1.5°C. The economic effects of mitigation action vary across regions and countries, and ambitious mitigation pathways imply large changes in economic structure.

Text: Net Zero Emissions: Timing and Implications  From a physical science perspective, limiting human-caused global warming to a specific level requires limiting cumulative CO2 emissions, reaching net zero or net negative CO2 emissions, along with strong reductions of other GHG emissions . Global modelled pathways that reach and sustain net zero GHG emissions are projected to result in a gradual decline in surface temperature. Reaching net zero GHG emissions primarily requires deep reductions in CO2, methane, and other GHG emissions, and implies net negative CO2 emissions.134 Carbon dioxide removal will be necessary to achieve net negative CO2 emissions 135. Achieving global net zero CO2 emissions, with remaining anthropogenic CO 2 emissions balanced by durably stored CO 2 from anthropogenic removal, is a requirement to stabilise CO2-induced global surface temperature increase . This is different from achieving net zero GHG emissions, where metric-weighted anthropogenic GHG emissions  equal CO 2 removal. Emissions pathways that reach and sustain net zero GHG emissions defined by the 100-year global warming potential imply net negative CO2 emissions and are projected to result in a gradual decline in surface temperature after an earlier peak. While reaching net zero CO2 or net zero GHG emissions requires deep and rapid reductions in gross emissions, the deployment of CDR to counterbalance hardto-abate residual emissions  is unavoidable .  In modelled pathways, the timing of net zero CO2 emissions, followed by net zero GHG emissions, depends on several variables, including the desired climate outcome, the mitigation strategy and the gases covered. Global net zero CO2 emissions are reached in the early 2050s in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, and around the early 2070s in pathways that limit warming to 2°C. While non-CO2 GHG emissions are strongly reduced in all pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower, residual emissions of CH4 and N2O and F-gases of about 8 [5–11] GtCO2 -eq yr -1 remain at the time of net zero GHG, counterbalanced by net negative CO2 emissions. As a result, net zero CO2 would be reached before net zero GHGs . Overshoot Pathways: Increased Risks and Other  Implications Exceeding a specific remaining carbon budget results in higher global warming. Achieving and sustaining net negative global CO 2 emissions could reverse the resulting temperature exceedance. Continued reductions in emissions of short-lived climate forcers, particularly methane, after peak temperature has been reached, would also further reduce warming. Only a small number of the most ambitious global modelled pathways limit global warming to 1.5°C without overshoot.  Overshoot of a warming level results in more adverse impacts, some irreversible, and additional risks for human and natural systems compared to staying below that warming level, with risks growing with the magnitude and duration of overshoot. Compared to pathways without overshoot, societies and ecosystems would be exposed to greater and more widespread changes in climatic impact-drivers, such as extreme heat and extreme precipitation, with increasing risks to infrastructure, low-lying coastal settlements, and associated livelihoods. Overshooting 1.5°C will result in irreversible adverse impacts on certain ecosystems with low resilience, such as polar, mountain, and coastal ecosystems, impacted by ice-sheet melt, glacier melt, or by accelerating and higher committed sea level rise. Overshoot increases the risks of severe impacts, such as increased wildfires, mass mortality of trees, drying of peatlands, thawing of permafrost and weakening natural land carbon sinks; such impacts could increase releases of GHGs making temperature reversal more challenging.  The larger the overshoot, the more net negative CO2 emissions needed to return to a given warming level. Reducing global temperature by removing CO 2 would require net negative emissions of 220 GtCO 2 for every tenth of a degree. Modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot reach median values of cumulative net negative emissions of 220 GtCO2 by 2100, pathways that return warming to 1.5°C after high overshoot reach median values of 360 GtCO2. 137 More rapid reduction in CO 2 and non-CO2 emissions, particularly methane, limits peak warming levels and reduces the requirement for net negative CO2 emissions and CDR, thereby reducing feasibility and sustainability concerns, and social and environmental risks .

Text: Impacts and Related Risks  For a given level of warming, many climate-related risks are assessed to be higher than in AR5. Levels of risk for all Reasons for Concern 121 are assessed to become high to very high at lower global warming levels compared to what was assessed in AR5. This is based upon recent evidence of observed impacts, improved process understanding, and new knowledge on exposure and vulnerability of human and natural systems, including limits to adaptation. Depending on the level of global warming, the assessed long-term impacts will be up to multiple times higher than currently observed for 127 identified key risks, e.g., in terms of the number of affected people and species. Risks, including cascading risks and risks from overshoot, are projected to become increasingly severe with every increment of global warming.  Climate-related risks for natural and human systems are higher for global warming of 1.5°C than at present but lower than at 2°C . Climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth are projected to increase with global warming of 1.5°C. In terrestrial ecosystems, 3 to 14% of the tens of thousands of species assessed will likely face a very high risk of extinction at a GWL of 1.5°C. Coral reefs are projected to decline by a further 70–90% at 1.5°C of global warming. At this GWL, many low-elevation and small glaciers around the world would lose most of their mass or disappear within decades to centuries. Regions at disproportionately higher risk include Arctic ecosystems, dryland regions, small island developing states and Least Developed Countries .  At 2°C of global warming, overall risk levels associated with the unequal distribution of impacts, global aggregate impacts and large-scale singular events would be transitioning to high , those associated with extreme weather events would be transitioning to very high, and those associated with unique and threatened systems would be very high  . With about 2°C warming, climate-related changes in food availability and diet quality are estimated to increase nutrition-related diseases and the number of undernourished people, affecting tens to hundreds of millions of people, particularly among low-income households in low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Central America. For example, snowmelt water availability for irrigation is projected to decline in some snowmelt dependent river basins by up to 20% . Climate change risks to cities, settlements and key infrastructure will rise sharply in the mid and long term with further global warming, especially in places already exposed to high temperatures, along coastlines, or with high vulnerabilities .  At global warming of 3°C, additional risks in many sectors and regions reach high or very high levels, implying widespread systemic impacts, irreversible change and many additional adaptation limits . For example, very high extinction risk for endemic species in biodiversity hotspots is projected to increase at least tenfold if warming rises from 1.5°C to 3°C. Projected increases in direct flood damages are higher by 1.4 to 2 times at 2°C and 2.5 to 3.9 times at 3°C, compared to 1.5°C global warming without adaptation.  Global warming of 4°C and above is projected to lead to far-reaching impacts on natural and human systems. Beyond 4°C of warming, projected impacts on natural systems include local extinction of ~50% of tropical marine species and biome shifts across 35% of global land area. At this level of warming, approximately 10% of the global land area is projected to face both increasing high and decreasing low extreme streamflow, affecting, without additional adaptation, over 2.1 billion people and about 4 billion people are projected to experience water scarcity. At 4°C of warming, the global burned area is projected to increase by 50 to 70% and the fire frequency by ~30% compared to today.  Projected adverse impacts and related losses and damages from climate change escalate with every increment of global warming , but they will also strongly depend on socio-economic development trajectories and adaptation actions to reduce vulnerability and exposure. For example, development pathways with higher demand for food, animal feed, and water, more resource-intensive consumption and production, and limited technological improvements result in higher risks from water scarcity in drylands, land degradation and food insecurity . Changes in, for example, demography or investments in health systems have effect on a variety of health-related outcomes including heat-related morbidity and mortality.  With every increment of warming, climate change impacts and risks will become increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. Many regions are projected to experience an increase in the probability of compound events with higher global warming, such as concurrent heatwaves and droughts, compound flooding and fire weather. In addition, multiple climatic and non-climatic risk drivers such as biodiversity loss or violent conflict will interact, resulting in compounding overall risk and risks cascading across sectors and regions. Furthermore, risks can arise from some responses that are intended to reduce the risks of climate change, e.g., adverse side effects of some emission reduction and carbon dioxide removal measures .  Solar Radiation Modification approaches, if they were to be implemented, introduce a widespread range of new risks to people and ecosystems, which are not well understood. SRM has the potential to offset warming within one or two decades and ameliorate some climate hazards but would not restore climate to a previous state, and substantial residual or overcompensating climate change would occur at regional and seasonal scales. Effects of SRM would depend on the specific approach used 122, and a sudden and sustained termination of SRM in a high CO 2 emissions scenario would cause rapid climate change. SRM would not stop atmospheric CO 2 concentrations from increasing nor reduce resulting ocean acidification under continued anthropogenic emissions. Large uncertainties and knowledge gaps are associated with the potential of SRM approaches to reduce climate change risks. Lack of robust and formal SRM governance poses risks as deployment by a limited number of states could create international tensions. Overshoot Pathways: Increased Risks and Other  Implications Exceeding a specific remaining carbon budget results in higher global warming. Achieving and sustaining net negative global CO 2 emissions could reverse the resulting temperature exceedance. Continued reductions in emissions of short-lived climate forcers, particularly methane, after peak temperature has been reached, would also further reduce warming.

Text: Sectoral Contributions to Mitigation  All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 involve rapid and deep and in most cases immediate GHG emissions reductions in all sectors. Reductions in GHG emissions in industry, transport, buildings, and urban areas can be achieved through a combination of energy efficiency and conservation and a transition to low-GHG technologies and energy carriers. Socio-cultural options and behavioural change can reduce global GHG emissions of end-use sectors, with most of the potential in developed countries, if combined with improved infrastructure design and access.  Global modelled mitigation pathways reaching net zero CO2 and GHG emissions include transitioning from fossil fuels without carbon capture and storage to very low- or zero-carbon energy sources, such as renewables or fossil fuels with CCS, demand-side measures and improving efficiency, reducing non-CO2 GHG emissions, and CDR 136. In global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or below, almost all electricity is supplied from zero or low-carbon sources in 2050, such as renewables or fossil fuels with CO2 capture and storage, combined with increased electrification of energy demand. Such pathways meet energy service demand with relatively low energy use, through e.g., enhanced energy efficiency and behavioural changes and increased electrification of energy end use. Modelled global pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot generally implement such changes faster than pathways limiting global warming to 2°C.  AFOLU mitigation options, when sustainably implemented, can deliver large-scale GHG emission reductions and enhanced CO2 removal; however, barriers to implementation and trade-offs may result from the impacts of climate change, competing demands on land, conflicts with food security and livelihoods, the complexity of land ownership and management systems, and cultural aspects. All assessed modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 include land-based mitigation and land-use change, with most including different combinations of reforestation, afforestation, reduced deforestation, and bioenergy. However, accumulated carbon in vegetation and soils is at risk from future loss triggered by climate change and disturbances such as flood, drought, fire, or pest outbreaks, or future poor management.  In addition to deep, rapid, and sustained emission reductions, CDR can fulfil three complementary roles: lowering net CO2 or net GHG emissions in the near term; counterbalancing ‘hard-to-abate’ residual emissions  to help reach net zero CO2 or GHG emissions, and achieving net negative CO 2 or GHG emissions if deployed at levels exceeding annual residual emissions. CDR methods vary in terms of their maturity, removal process, time scale of carbon storage, storage medium, mitigation potential, cost, co-benefits, impacts and risks, and governance requirements. Specifically, maturity ranges from lower maturity to higher maturity; removal and storage potential ranges from lower potential to higher potential; costs range from lower cost to higher cost  . Estimated storage timescales vary from decades to centuries for methods that store carbon in vegetation and through soil carbon management, to ten thousand years or more for methods that store carbon in geological formations . Afforestation, reforestation, improved forest management, agroforestry and soil carbon sequestration are currently the only widely practiced CDR methods. Methods and levels of CDR deployment in global modelled mitigation pathways vary depending on assumptions about costs, availability and constraints. Overshoot Pathways: Increased Risks and Other  Implications Exceeding a specific remaining carbon budget results in higher global warming. Achieving and sustaining net negative global CO 2 emissions could reverse the resulting temperature exceedance. Continued reductions in emissions of short-lived climate forcers, particularly methane, after peak temperature has been reached, would also further reduce warming. Only a small number of the most ambitious global modelled pathways limit global warming to 1.5°C without overshoot.

Synergies and trade-offs, costs and benefits  Mitigation and adaptation options can lead to synergies and trade-offs with other aspects of sustainable development . Synergies and trade-offs depend on the pace and magnitude of changes and the development context including inequalities, with consideration of climate justice. The potential or effectiveness of some adaptation and mitigation options decreases as climate change intensifies .  In the energy sector, transitions to low-emission systems will have multiple co-benefits, including improvements in air quality and health. There are potential synergies between sustainable development and, for instance, energy efficiency and renewable energy.  For agriculture, land, and food systems, many land management options and demand-side response options  can contribute to eradicating poverty and eliminating hunger while promoting good health and well-being, clean water and sanitation, and life on land . In contrast, certain adaptation options that promote intensification of production, such as irrigation, may have negative effects on sustainability  .  Reforestation, improved forest management, soil carbon sequestration, peatland restoration and coastal blue carbon management are examples of CDR methods that can enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functions, employment and local livelihoods, depending on context . However, afforestation or production of biomass crops for bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage or biochar can have adverse socio-economic and environmental impacts, including on biodiversity, food and water security, local livelihoods and the rights of Indigenous Peoples, especially if implemented at large scales and where land tenure is insecure.  Modelled pathways that assume using resources more efficiently or shift global development towards sustainability include fewer challenges, such as dependence on CDR and pressure on land and biodiversity, and have the most pronounced synergies with respect to sustainable development .  Strengthening climate change mitigation action entails more rapid transitions and higher up-front investments, but brings benefits from avoiding damages from climate change and reduced adaptation costs. The aggregate effects of climate change mitigation on global GDP  are small compared to global projected GDP growth. Projected estimates of global aggregate net economic damages and the costs of adaptation generally increase with global warming level.  Cost-benefit analysis remains limited in its ability to represent all damages from climate change, including non-monetary damages, or to capture the heterogeneous nature of damages and the risk of catastrophic damages. Even without accounting for these factors or for the co-benefits of mitigation, the global benefits of limiting warming to 2°C exceed the cost of mitigation . This finding is robust against a wide range of assumptions about social preferences on inequalities and discounting over time . Limiting global warming to 1.5°C instead of 2°C would increase the costs of mitigation, but also increase the benefits in terms of reduced impacts and related risks and reduced adaptation needs 140.  Considering other sustainable development dimensions, such as the potentially strong economic benefits on human health from air quality improvement, may enhance the estimated benefits of mitigation . The economic effects of strengthened mitigation action vary across regions and countries, depending notably on economic structure, regional emissions reductions, policy design and level of international cooperation. Ambitious mitigation pathways imply large and sometimes disruptive changes in economic structure, with implications for near-term actions, equity , sustainability, and finance .

Text: Long-Term Interactions Between Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development  Mitigation and adaptation can lead to synergies and trade-offs with sustainable development. Accelerated and equitable mitigation and adaptation bring benefits from avoiding damages from climate change and are critical to achieving sustainable development. Climate resilient development 138 pathways are progressively constrained by every increment of further warming. There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all. Advancing Integrated Climate Action for Sustainable  Development An inclusive, equitable approach to integrating adaptation, mitigation and development can advance sustainable development in the long term. Integrated responses can harness synergies for sustainable development and reduce trade-offs. Shifting development pathways towards sustainability and advancing climate resilient development is enabled when governments, civil society and the private sector make development choices that prioritise risk reduction, equity and justice, and when decision-making processes, finance and actions are integrated across governance levels, sectors and timeframes. Inclusive processes involving local knowledge and Indigenous Knowledge increase these prospects. However, opportunities for action differ substantially among and within regions, driven by historical and ongoing patterns of development. Accelerated financial support for developing countries is critical to enhance mitigation and adaptation action.  Policies that shift development pathways towards sustainability can broaden the portfolio of available mitigation and adaptation responses. Combining mitigation with action to shift development pathways, such as broader sectoral policies, approaches that induce lifestyle or behaviour changes, financial regulation, or macroeconomic policies can overcome barriers and open up a broader range of mitigation options. Integrated, inclusive planning and investment in everyday decisionmaking about urban infrastructure can significantly increase the adaptive capacity of urban and rural settlements. Coastal cities and settlements play an important role in advancing climate resilient development due to the high number of people living in the Low Elevation Coastal Zone, the escalating and climate compounded risk that they face, and their vital role in national economies and beyond .  Observed adverse impacts and related losses and damages, projected risks, trends in vulnerability, and adaptation limits demonstrate that transformation for sustainability and climate resilient development action is more urgent than previously assessed. Climate resilient development integrates adaptation and GHG mitigation to advance sustainable development for all. Climate resilient development pathways have been constrained by past development, emissions and climate change and are progressively constrained by every increment of warming, in particular beyond 1.5°C. Climate resilient development will not be possible in some regions and sub-regions if global warming exceeds 2°C. Safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystems is fundamental to climate resilient development, but biodiversity and ecosystem services have limited capacity to adapt to increasing global warming levels, making climate resilient development progressively harder to achieve beyond 1.5°C warming.  The cumulative scientific evidence is unequivocal: climate change is a threat to human well-being and planetary health . Any further delay in concerted anticipatory global action on adaptation and mitigation will miss a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all. Opportunities for near-term action are assessed in the following section. The Timing and Urgency of Climate Action  The magnitude and rate of climate change and associated risks depend strongly on near-term mitigation and adaptation actions . Global warming is more likely than not to reach 1.5°C between 2021 and 2040 even under the very low GHG emission scenarios, and likely or very likely to exceed 1.5°C under higher emissions scenarios 141. Many adaptation options have medium or high feasibility up to 1.5°C , but hard limits to adaptation have already been reached in some ecosystems and the effectiveness of adaptation to reduce climate risk will decrease with increasing warming. Societal choices and actions implemented in this decade determine the extent to which medium- and long-term pathways will deliver higher or lower climate resilient development. Climate resilient development prospects are increasingly limited if current greenhouse gas emissions do not rapidly decline, especially if 1.5°C global warming is exceeded in the near term. Without urgent, effective and equitable adaptation and mitigation actions, climate change increasingly threatens the health and livelihoods of people around the globe, ecosystem health, and biodiversity, with severe adverse consequences for current and future generations. .  In modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot and in those that limit warming to 2°C, assuming immediate actions, global GHG emissions are projected to peak in the early 2020s followed by rapid and deep GHG emissions reductions 142 . In pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, net global GHG emissions are projected to fall by 43 [34 to 60]%143 below 2019 levels by 2030, 60 [49 to 77]% by 2035, 69 [58 to 90]% by 2040 and 84 [73 to 98]% by 2050 144. Global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C have reductions in GHG emissions below 2019 levels of 21 [1 to 42]% by 2030, 35 [22 to 55] % by 2035, 46 [34 to 63] % by 2040 and 64 [53 to 77]% by 2050145. Global GHG emissions associated with NDCs announced prior to COP26 would make it likely that warming would exceed 1.5°C and limiting warming to 2°C would then imply a rapid acceleration of emission reductions during 2030–2050, around 70% faster than in pathways where immediate action is taken to limit warming to 2°C Continued investments in unabated high-emitting infrastructure and limited development and deployment of low-emitting alternatives prior to 2030 would act as barriers to this acceleration and increase feasibility risks.  All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 involve reductions in both net CO 2 emissions and non-CO 2 emissions. For example, in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, global CH4 emissions are reduced by 34 [21 to 57]% below 2019 levels by 2030 and by 44 [31 to 63]% in 2040. Global CH 4 emissions are reduced by 24 [9 to 53]% below 2019 levels by 2030 and by 37 [20 to 60]% in 2040 in modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C with action starting in 2020.  All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 involve GHG emission reductions in all sectors . The contributions of different sectors vary across modelled mitigation pathways. In most global modelled mitigation pathways, emissions from land-use, land-use change and forestry, via reforestation and reduced deforestation, and from the energy supply sector reach net zero CO2 emissions earlier than the buildings, industry and transport sectors. Strategies can rely on combinations of different options, but doing less in one sector needs to be compensated by further reductions in other sectors if warming is to be limited.  Without rapid, deep and sustained mitigation and accelerated adaptation actions, losses and damages will continue to increase, including projected adverse impacts in Africa, LDCs, SIDS, Central and South America , Asia and the Arctic, and will disproportionately affect the most vulnerable populations .   [/INST]","The text emphasizes the urgency of taking action to address climate change through both mitigation (reducing greenhouse gas emissions) and adaptation (building resilience to the impacts of climate change). The text states that the window of opportunity to secure a livable and sustainable future for all is closing, and that climate-resilient development is crucial for long-term sustainability. The text also highlights the importance of inclusive, equitable approaches to climate action, and the role of coastal cities and settlements in advancing climate-resilient development. The text also emphasizes the need for immediate, effective, and equitable adaptation and mitigation actions to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, and the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to limit warming to 1.5°C or 2°C.

Text: The text emphasizes the importance of both mitigation and adaptation efforts in relation to sustainable development, as they can lead to synergies and trade-offs. The text also highlights the benefits of accelerated and equitable implementation of these strategies in avoiding damages from climate change and contributing to sustainable development. Additionally, the text warns that the number of climate-resilient development pathways is progressively constrained with each increment of further warming, and there is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a livable and sustainable future for all.</s>  The text emphasizes the importance of taking near-term action to adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change. The benefits of accelerated adaptation include reducing losses and damages, especially for vulnerable populations, and enhancing sustainable development co-benefits. Near-term actions involve higher up-front investments and disruptive changes, but can be moderated by enabling conditions and the removal or reduction of barriers to feasibility.  The text also highlights the importance of limiting global warming to close to 1.5°C to reduce projected losses and damages, but notes that this cannot eliminate all adverse impacts. The text emphasizes the strong relationship between near-term mitigation and adaptation actions and the magnitude and rate of climate change and associated risks. Delayed mitigation action will increase global warming, decreasing the effectiveness of many adaptation options and increasing mitigation feasibility risks.  The text also notes that mitigation actions will have co-benefits, such as improving air quality and human health. Strong, rapid, and sustained reductions in methane emissions can limit near-term warming and improve air quality. The text also discusses the challenges of delayed adaptation and mitigation actions, including the risk of cost escalation, lock-in of infrastructure, stranded assets, and reduced feasibility and effectiveness of adaptation and mitigation options.  The text emphasizes the importance of equitable and inclusive climate action, and the need for deeper fiscal, financial, institutional, and regulatory reforms to offset adverse effects and unlock mitigation potentials. The text also discusses the need to address a range of barriers to feasibility and effectiveness of responses, including economic, technological, institutional, social, environmental, and geophysical barriers. The text concludes by emphasizing the importance of integrating ambitious climate actions with macroeconomic policies and providing broadened access to finance, technology, and capacity-building to support low-emission infrastructure, especially in developing regions.</s>  The text emphasizes the importance of equity, inclusion, and social justice in climate change action. Prioritizing these elements leads to more sustainable outcomes, reduces trade-offs, supports transformative change, and advances climate resilient development. Adaptation and mitigation actions that prioritize equity, inclusion, and just transitions enable deeper societal ambitions and resolve trade-offs with sustainable development goals. Vulnerability to climate change is higher in regions and populations with development constraints, poverty, and limited access to basic services and resources. Meaningful participation and inclusive planning, informed by cultural values, Indigenous Knowledge, local knowledge, and scientific knowledge, can help address adaptation gaps and avoid maladaptation. Integrating climate adaptation into social protection programs, such as cash transfers and public works programs, increases resilience to climate change. Equity, inclusion, and just transitions enable deeper societal ambitions for accelerated mitigation and climate action. The text also discusses the importance of addressing historical and ongoing patterns of inequity, such as colonialism, and exacerbating factors like gender, ethnicity, and low income. The text suggests that economic and regulatory instruments, as well as behavioral interventions, can be effective in reducing emissions while addressing distributional goals and social acceptance. Additionally, the text highlights the importance of broadening equitable access to finance, technologies, and governance to facilitate mitigation and shifting development pathways in low-income contexts. Eradicating extreme poverty and providing decent living standards in regions can be achieved without significant global emissions growth through technology development, transfer, capacity building, and financing. Climate resilient development is advanced when actors work in equitable, just, and enabling ways to reconcile divergent interests, values, and worldviews.</s>  The text emphasizes the urgency of making near-term transitions across all sectors and systems to achieve deep emissions reductions and secure a sustainable future. These transitions involve a wide range of feasible, effective, and low-cost mitigation and adaptation options. The text highlights the need for more rapid and pronounced system transitions to limit warming to 1.5°C compared to 2°C. The text also mentions that while the scale of these transitions is unprecedented, the speed is not.  The text also mentions that feasible, effective, and low-cost mitigation and adaptation options are already available, with differences across systems and regions. Mitigation options with a cost of USD 100 tCO2-eq–1 or less could reduce global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least half the 2019 level by 2030.  Demand-side measures and new ways of end-use service provision can reduce global GHG emissions in end-use sectors by 40 to 70% by 2050 compared to baseline scenarios. Demand-side mitigation includes changes in infrastructure use, end-use technology adoption, and socio-cultural and behavioral change. Some regions and socioeconomic groups may require additional energy and resources.</s>  The text emphasizes the importance of political commitment, effective governance, and well-aligned institutional frameworks for addressing climate change through clear goals, adequate financing, coordination across policy domains, and inclusive governance processes. The text highlights the success of various climate policy instruments, such as laws, regulations, and carbon pricing, in reducing emissions and increasing climate resilience. It also emphasizes the importance of drawing on diverse knowledge and partnerships, including with Indigenous Peoples, women, youth, and local communities, to facilitate climate-resilient development. The text also discusses the role of climate-related litigation in influencing climate governance and the importance of inclusive decision-making processes, resource allocation, and institutional review, monitoring, and evaluation in effective climate governance. Additionally, the text discusses the importance of scaling up and enhancing the use of regulatory instruments, removing fossil fuel subsidies, and implementing economy-wide packages to reduce emissions and shift development pathways towards sustainability.</s>  The text emphasizes the importance of finance, international cooperation, and technology in accelerating climate action. To achieve climate goals, significant increases in adaptation and mitigation financing are necessary. While there is enough global capital to close the investment gaps, there are barriers preventing the redirection of capital towards climate action. These barriers include institutional, regulatory, and market access issues, particularly in developing countries with economic vulnerability and indebtedness. The text suggests that enhancing international cooperation through multiple channels and technology innovation systems is crucial to reducing these barriers and accelerating the adoption of climate technologies and practices.</s>  [/INST]","The text emphasizes the importance of both mitigation and adaptation efforts in relation to sustainable development, highlighting the benefits of accelerated and equitable implementation of these strategies in avoiding damages from climate change and contributing to sustainable development.

Text: The text discusses the risks of continued emissions leading to abrupt and irreversible changes in the Earth's climate system. The risks increase with higher global warming levels and include extinction of species, loss of biodiversity, ice sheet instability, and ecosystem loss. Sea level rise is unavoidable and will continue to increase throughout the 21st century and beyond. The magnitude and rate of sea level rise depend on emissions, with higher emissions leading to greater and faster rates. Extreme sea level events will become more frequent, and coastal ecosystems, people, and infrastructure will be at increasing risk. The Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets are likely to be lost almost completely over multiple millennia if warming levels remain between 2°C and 3°C. Global mean sea level rise is projected to be between 2 to 6 meters by 2300 under a high emissions scenario. Other unavoidable changes include continued glacier melt and permafrost carbon loss. The probability of low-likelihood outcomes with very large impacts increases with higher global warming levels. The text also mentions the possibility of compound extreme events, such as a weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, which could lead to significant regional climate shifts and impacts on ecosystems and human activities. Additionally, there is a low probability of large explosive volcanic eruptions, which could lead to substantial cooling and regional climate perturbations over several decades.</s>  The text discusses the risks of continued emissions and the need for deep, rapid, and sustained emission reductions across various sectors to limit global warming to 2°C or lower by 2100. The following are the main takeaways from the text with respect to the topic:  1. Rapid and deep emissions reductions are necessary in all sectors, including industry, transport, buildings, and urban areas, through a combination of energy efficiency, conservation, and transition to low-GHG technologies and energy carriers. 2. Socio-cultural options and behavioral change can also reduce global GHG emissions in end-use sectors, particularly in developed countries, if combined with improved infrastructure design and access. 3. Global modelled mitigation pathways reaching net-zero CO2 and GHG emissions include transitioning from fossil fuels to very low- or zero-carbon energy sources, such as renewables or fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage (CCS), demand-side measures, and improving efficiency. 4. Almost all electricity is supplied from zero or low-carbon sources in 2050 in such pathways, and energy service demand is met with relatively low energy use through enhanced energy efficiency, behavioral changes, and increased electrification of energy end use. 5. Modelled global pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot generally implement changes faster than pathways limiting global warming to 2°C. 6. Agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU) mitigation options can deliver large-scale GHG emission reductions and enhanced CO2 removal but face barriers to implementation and trade-offs due to climate change impacts, competing demands on land, food security, livelihoods, land ownership and management systems, and cultural aspects. 7. All assessed modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 include land-based mitigation and land-use change, with most including different combinations of reforestation, afforestation, reduced deforestation, and bioenergy. 8. Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) can fulfill three complementary roles: lowering net CO2 or net GHG emissions in the near term, counterbalancing hard-to-abate residual emissions to help reach net-zero CO2 or GHG emissions, and achieving net negative CO2 or GHG emissions if deployed at levels exceeding annual residual emissions. 9. CDR methods vary in terms of their maturity, removal process, time scale of carbon storage, storage medium, mitigation potential, cost, co-benefits, impacts and risks, and governance requirements. 10. Currently, afforestation, reforestation, improved forest management, agroforestry, and soil carbon sequestration are the only widely practiced CDR methods. 11. Methods and levels of CDR deployment in global modelled mitigation pathways vary depending on assumptions about costs, availability, and constraints.</s>  The text discusses the interconnections between climate change mitigation and adaptation, sustainable development, and various sectors such as energy and agriculture. The text highlights that synergies and trade-offs exist between these areas, and their effectiveness depends on the pace and context of development. In the energy sector, transitioning to low-emission systems can lead to co-benefits like improved air quality and health. For agriculture, land management options and demand-side responses can contribute to sustainable development goals while some adaptation options may have negative impacts. Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) methods like reforestation and improved forest management can enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functions, but large-scale afforestation or biomass production for bioenergy can have adverse socio-economic and environmental impacts. The text also mentions that cost-benefit analysis has limitations in capturing all damages from climate change and the co-benefits of mitigation. Despite these challenges, the benefits of limiting warming to 2°C exceed the costs, and limiting it to 1.5°C would increase the costs but also the benefits. The economic effects of mitigation action vary across regions and countries, and ambitious mitigation pathways imply large changes in economic structure.</s>  The text emphasizes the urgency of taking near-term action to mitigate and adapt to climate change, as global warming is projected to exceed 1.5°C within the next few decades even under low emission scenarios. Adaptation options become less effective as warming increases, and failure to act urgently threatens people's health, livelihoods, ecosystems, and biodiversity. The text also outlines the projected GHG emissions reductions required to limit warming to 1.5°C or 2°C, with deeper reductions needed in the former scenario. The text also highlights the importance of reducing non-CO2 emissions, such as CH4, and the need for emissions reductions in all sectors. The text warns of the consequences of continued investments in high-emitting infrastructure and the importance of accelerated adaptation actions to avoid increasing losses and damages, particularly for vulnerable populations.</s>  The text emphasizes the importance of taking near-term actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change. These actions include accelerating adaptation to reduce losses and damages, especially for vulnerable populations, and implementing deep, rapid, and sustained mitigation to avoid locking-in emission sources and reduce stranded assets. The text also highlights the co-benefits of mitigation, such as improved air quality and human health.  However, the text also warns of the risks of delayed action, including the risk of cost escalation, lock-in of infrastructure, and reduced feasibility and effectiveness of adaptation and mitigation options. The text suggests that scaling-up climate action will require a mix of low-cost and high-cost options, and that deeper fiscal, financial, institutional, and regulatory reforms can offset any adverse effects.  The text also emphasizes the importance of addressing equity and inclusion in climate action, achieving synergies and reducing trade-offs with sustainable development goals, and integrating near-term actions across sectors, systems, and regions. It also highlights the need to reduce or remove barriers to feasibility and effectiveness of responses, including economic, technological, institutional, social, environmental, and geophysical barriers.  Overall, the text stresses the urgency of taking near-term actions to address climate change and the importance of integrating these actions with sustainable development goals and addressing equity and inclusion.</s>  The text discusses the near-term risks of continued emissions on both human systems and natural ecosystems. The risks include increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, marine heatwaves, heavy precipitation, and flooding. These events will lead to various consequences, including biodiversity loss, food and water scarcity, health risks, and economic damages. The risks will be more pronounced in regions with high exposure and vulnerability, such as low-lying coastal areas and small island developing states. The text also emphasizes the importance of considering natural variability in adaptation planning and the role of socio-economic development trends in increasing exposure and vulnerability. The text also mentions that several near-term risks can be moderated with adaptation, but losses and damages will continue to increase with every increment of global warming and will be strongly concentrated among the poorest vulnerable populations. The text also mentions the risks of maladaptation and adverse side effects of some emissions reduction and carbon dioxide removal measures. Overall, the text highlights the urgent need for action to reduce emissions and adapt to the inevitable impacts of climate change in the near term.</s>  The text emphasizes the importance of equity, inclusion, and social justice in climate change action. Prioritizing these elements leads to more sustainable outcomes, reduces trade-offs, and advances climate resilient development. Adaptation and mitigation actions that focus on equity, inclusion, and just transitions enable deeper societal ambitions and resolve trade-offs with sustainable development goals. Vulnerability to climate change is higher in regions with poverty, governance challenges, and limited access to basic services and resources. Adaptation gaps exist among lower income population groups, and meaningful participation and inclusive planning can help address these gaps. Integrating climate adaptation into social protection programs and broadening equitable access to finance, technologies, and governance can help share benefits and burdens equitably. Just transition principles can be integrated into policies at all scales to address distributional consequences of mitigation efforts. Economic and regulatory instruments, as well as behavioral interventions, can be effective in reducing emissions while addressing distributional goals and social acceptance. Individuals with high socio-economic status contribute disproportionately to emissions and have the highest potential for emissions reductions. Broadening equitable access to finance, technologies, and capacity can act as a catalyst for accelerating mitigation and shifting development pathways in low-income contexts. Climate resilient development is advanced when actors work in equitable, just, and enabling ways to reconcile divergent interests, values, and worldviews.</s>  [/INST]","The text discusses the risks of continued emissions on both human systems and natural ecosystems, emphasizing the urgency of taking near-term actions to reduce emissions and adapt to the inevitable impacts of climate change.

The text discusses the risks of continued emissions and the need for deep, rapid, and sustained emission reductions across various sectors, including industry, transport, buildings, and urban areas, through a combination of energy efficiency, conservation, and transition to low-GHG technologies and energy carriers. Socio-cultural options and behavioral change can also reduce global GHG emissions in end-use sectors, particularly in developed countries.

The text also mentions that cost-benefit analysis has limitations in capturing all damages from climate change and the co-benefits of mitigation. Despite these challenges, the benefits of limiting warming to 2°C exceed the costs, and limiting it to 1.5°C would increase the costs but also the benefits. The economic effects of mitigation action vary across regions and countries, and ambitious mitigation pathways imply large changes in economic structure.

The text emphasizes the importance of taking near-term actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change, as global warming is projected to exceed 1.5°C within the next few decades even under low emission scenarios. Adaptation options become less effective as warming increases, and failure to act urgently threatens people's health, livelihoods, ecosystems, and biodiversity. The text also warns of the consequences of continued investments in high-emitting infrastructure and the importance of accelerated adaptation actions to avoid increasing losses and damages, particularly for vulnerable populations.

The text also outlines the projected GHG emissions reductions required to limit warming to 1.5°C or 2°C, with deeper reductions needed in the former scenario. The text also highlights the importance of reducing or removing barriers to feasibility and effectiveness of responses, including economic, technological, institutional, social, environmental, and geophysical barriers.

The text discusses the interconnections between climate change mitigation and adaptation, sustainable development, and various sectors such as energy and agriculture. The text highlights that synergies and trade-offs exist between these areas, and their effectiveness depends on the pace and context of development. In the energy sector, transitioning to low-emission systems can lead to co-benefits like improved air quality and health. For agriculture, land management options and demand-side responses can contribute to sustainable development goals while some adaptation options may have negative impacts. Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) methods like reforestation and improved forest management can enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functions, but large-scale afforestation or biomass production for bioenergy can have adverse socio-economic and environmental impacts.

Text: The text emphasizes the urgency and importance of near-term mitigation and adaptation actions to address climate change. The global warming is projected to reach 1.5°C between 2021 and 2040, and the effectiveness of adaptation will decrease with increasing warming. Societal choices and actions in this decade determine the extent of climate-resilient development. Without urgent and effective adaptation and mitigation actions, climate change poses significant risks to people, ecosystems, and biodiversity.  The text also provides projections for global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions in different scenarios. In scenarios that limit warming to 1.5°C, GHG emissions are projected to peak in the early 2020s and fall below 2019 levels by 43-84% by 2050. In scenarios that limit warming to 2°C, GHG emissions are projected to fall below 2019 levels by 21-64% by 2050. The text also highlights the importance of reducing non-CO2 emissions, such as methane (CH4), in limiting warming.  The text also emphasizes the importance of rapid, deep, and sustained mitigation and adaptation actions to limit losses and damages, which will disproportionately affect the most vulnerable populations. The text also mentions that different sectors, such as energy supply, land-use, land-use change and forestry, and buildings, industry, and transport, will have varying contributions to GHG emissions reductions.</s>  The text emphasizes the importance of both adaptation and mitigation actions to address climate change and its impacts. The benefits of accelerated implementation of adaptation include reducing losses and damages, especially for vulnerable populations, and improving human well-being. Near-term actions that limit global warming to close to 1.5°C will substantially reduce projected losses and damages, but cannot eliminate them all. Delayed mitigation action will increase global warming, decrease the effectiveness of many adaptation options, and increase the risk of stranded assets. Comprehensive responses integrating adaptation and mitigation can harness synergies and reduce trade-offs. Mitigation actions have co-benefits, such as improving air quality and human health. Scaling-up near-term climate actions will require a mix of low-cost and high-cost options, with high-cost options needed to avoid future lock-ins and foster innovation. Enabling conditions and reducing barriers to feasibility are essential to realize opportunities for deep and rapid adaptation and mitigation actions and climate resilient development. The text also highlights the need for equity and inclusion in climate action, rapid and far-reaching transitions, synergies with sustainable development goals, governance and policy improvements, access to finance, improved international cooperation, and technology improvements. Barriers to feasibility can be overcome by addressing a range of economic, technological, institutional, social, environmental, and geophysical barriers. Integrating ambitious climate actions with macroeconomic policies can provide benefits in terms of sustainable low-emission economic recovery, job creation, safety nets, and broadened access to finance, technology, and capacity-building.</s>  The text discusses the near-term risks of climate change and the benefits of adaptation. The key takeaways are:  1. Climate hazards will increase in the near term, leading to compounding and cascading impacts that will be more difficult to manage. 2. Losses and damages from climate change will increase with global warming and be concentrated among the poorest vulnerable populations. 3. Natural variability will modulate human-caused climate change, either attenuating or amplifying projected changes. 4. Human vulnerability to climate change will depend on trends in vulnerability, exposure, socio-economic development, and adaptation. 5. Several near-term risks can be moderated with adaptation, including increased intensity and frequency of hot extremes, marine heatwaves, extreme rainfall and flooding, sea level rise, and health risks. 6. Compounding and cascading risks from climate change will make these risks more severe and more difficult to manage, including when interacting with non-climatic risk drivers. 7. Losses and damages from climate change will be unequally distributed across systems, regions, and sectors and are not comprehensively addressed by current financial, governance, and institutional arrangements. 8. Adaptation is essential to reduce the impacts of climate change, but it does not prevent all losses and damages, even with effective adaptation and before reaching soft and hard limits. 9. The text highlights the importance of considering regional scales and natural variability in adaptation planning. 10. The text emphasizes the interdependence of human and ecosystem vulnerability and the need to address the root causes of vulnerability, including unsustainable consumption and production, growing inequality, and unsustainable use and management of land, ocean, and water.</s>  [/INST]","The text underscores the urgency of taking near-term actions to address climate change through both adaptation and mitigation.

Text: The text emphasizes the undeniable impact of human influence on climate change, with significant and unprecedented changes observed in various aspects of the climate system, including the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere. The text highlights the following key points:  1. Human influence is the primary driver of global warming, with ocean warming accounting for 91% of the heating in the climate system. 2. Sea level rise has increased significantly, with human influence being the main driver since at least 1971. 3. Human influence has contributed to the retreat of glaciers and the decrease in Arctic sea ice area. 4. Human-caused climate change is already affecting weather and climate extremes, with more frequent and intense heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones. 5. Climate change has caused substantial damages and irreversible losses in various ecosystems, including terrestrial, freshwater, cryospheric, and coastal and open ocean ecosystems. 6. Climate change has contributed to desertification, land degradation, and the loss of coastal wetlands. 7. Climate change has reduced food security and affected water security, hindering efforts to meet Sustainable Development Goals. 8. Climate change has caused adverse impacts on human health, livelihoods, and key infrastructure, particularly in urban settings. 9. Climate change has contributed to displacement and involuntary migration, generating and perpetuating vulnerability. 10. Economic damages from climate change are increasingly affecting peoples’ livelihoods and causing economic and societal impacts across national boundaries. 11. Vulnerability to climate change is unequally distributed, with the most vulnerable people and systems being disproportionately affected.  The text underscores the urgent need for mitigation and adaptation efforts to address the risks and impacts of climate change.</s>  The text discusses the increased risks of various climate-related impacts as global warming levels rise. At 1.5°C of global warming, risks to natural and human systems are higher than in the previous assessment, with significant impacts on health, food security, water supply, and economic growth. Extinction risks for species and coral reefs are also high. At 2°C, risks become high to very high for unique and threatened systems, extreme weather events, and food availability. At 3°C, risks reach high or very high levels in many sectors and regions, with significant impacts on biodiversity, water availability, and food security. At 4°C and above, far-reaching impacts on natural and human systems include local extinction of tropical marine species, biome shifts, and increased water scarcity. The text also notes that risks will depend on socio-economic development trajectories and adaptation actions. The text also mentions the risks of Solar Radiation Modification (SRM) approaches, which have the potential to offset warming but also introduce new risks and uncertainties. The text emphasizes the importance of understanding and addressing these risks to reduce vulnerability and exposure.</s>  The text discusses the risks and limits of delayed mitigation and the importance of adaptation to climate change. The main takeaways are:  1. Adaptation options become less effective and more constrained as warming increases, leading to increased losses and damages, particularly for the poorest populations. 2. Integrated, cross-cutting multi-sectoral solutions increase the effectiveness of adaptation. 3. Common adaptation responses in agriculture, water management, and ecosystem-based adaptation become less effective at higher levels of warming. 4. Adaptation to address heat stress, water scarcity, and sea level rise face soft and hard limits. 5. Maladaptive responses to climate change can create lock-ins of vulnerability, exposure, and risks, exacerbating existing inequalities. 6. Sea level rise poses a unique adaptation challenge, requiring a combination of protection, accommodation, advance, and planned relocation strategies. 7. Ecosystem-based solutions, such as wetlands and seawalls, provide co-benefits but have physical limits and can be maladaptive if not part of a long-term adaptive plan.</s>  The text discusses the concept of carbon budgets and the risks of delayed mitigation in limiting global temperature increase. The text states that there is a finite carbon budget for limiting warming to a specific level, and the remaining carbon budgets for limiting warming to 1.5°C and 2°C have been estimated based on various factors such as TCRE, historical warming, climate system feedbacks, and non-CO2 emissions. The text also highlights that the stronger the reductions in non-CO2 emissions, the lower the resulting temperatures are for a given carbon budget or the larger the carbon budget for the same level of temperature change.  The text also warns that if annual CO2 emissions between 2020-2030 stay at the same level as 2019, the remaining carbon budget for 1.5°C and 2°C will be exhausted. Historical cumulative net CO2 emissions between 1850 and 2019 have already taken up about four-fifths of the total carbon budget for a 50% probability of limiting global warming to 1.5°C and about two-thirds of the total carbon budget for a 67% probability to limit global warming to 2°C.  The text also mentions that natural land and ocean carbon sinks are projected to be less effective at slowing the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere as cumulative net CO2 emissions increase. Additional ecosystem responses to warming, such as GHG fluxes from wetlands, permafrost thaw, and wildfires, would further increase concentrations of these gases in the atmosphere. In scenarios where CO2 concentrations peak and decline during the 21st century, the land and ocean begin to take up less carbon in response to declining atmospheric CO2 concentrations and turn into a weak net source by 2100 in the very low GHG emissions scenario.  In summary, the text emphasizes the importance of limiting carbon emissions to stay below a certain temperature threshold and the risks of delayed mitigation. The text also highlights the role of natural carbon sinks and the impact of non-CO2 emissions on the carbon budget.</s>  The text discusses the risks of delayed mitigation and the importance of rapid and deep emissions reductions in various sectors to limit global warming to 2°C or lower by 2100. The text emphasizes the role of energy efficiency, low-GHG technologies, and behavioral change in reducing emissions in industry, transport, buildings, and urban areas. It also highlights the importance of transitioning from fossil fuels to very low- or zero-carbon energy sources, such as renewables or fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage.  The text also mentions the potential of socio-cultural options and behavioral change in reducing global GHG emissions in end-use sectors, particularly in developed countries. It notes that global modelled mitigation pathways reaching net zero CO2 and GHG emissions include land-based mitigation and land-use change, such as reforestation, afforestation, reduced deforestation, and bioenergy. However, it warns that accumulated carbon in vegetation and soils is at risk from future loss triggered by climate change and disturbances.  The text also discusses the role of Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) in lowering net CO2 or net GHG emissions in the near term, counterbalancing residual emissions, and achieving net negative CO2 or GHG emissions. It notes that CDR methods vary in terms of their maturity, removal process, time scale of carbon storage, storage medium, mitigation potential, cost, co-benefits, impacts and risks, and governance requirements. Currently, widely practiced CDR methods include afforestation, reforestation, improved forest management, agroforestry, and soil carbon sequestration. The text also mentions that the deployment of CDR methods in global modelled mitigation pathways varies depending on assumptions about costs, availability, and constraints.  Overall, the text emphasizes the importance of immediate and deep emissions reductions in all sectors, the role of low-carbon energy sources, and the potential of CDR in achieving net zero or negative emissions. It also highlights the challenges and risks associated with land-based mitigation and the importance of sustainable implementation of mitigation options.</s>  The text emphasizes the urgency and importance of near-term mitigation and adaptation actions to address climate change. The global warming is projected to reach 1.5°C between 2021 and 2040, and it is likely to exceed 1.5°C under higher emissions scenarios. Adaptation options have limits, and their effectiveness decreases with increasing warming. Societal choices and actions in this decade determine the extent of climate-resilient development.

In scenarios that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, global GHG emissions are projected to peak in the early 2020s and fall by 43-84% below 2019 levels by 2050. In contrast, in scenarios that limit warming to 2°C, global GHG emissions are projected to fall by 21-64% below 2019 levels by 2050. The text also highlights the importance of reducing non-CO2 emissions, such as methane (CH4), and the need for emissions reductions in all sectors.  The text also emphasizes the consequences of inaction, including increased risks to health, livelihoods, ecosystems, and biodiversity, and disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable populations. The text also mentions that continued investments in high-emitting infrastructure and limited development and deployment of low-emitting alternatives prior to 2030 act as barriers to accelerated emission reductions during 2030-2050.  In summary, the text underscores the importance of urgent and effective climate action to limit global warming to 1.5°C or lower, the need for deep and sustained emissions reductions across all sectors, and the consequences of inaction.</s>  The text emphasizes the importance of taking near-term actions to mitigate climate change and adapt to its impacts, particularly for vulnerable populations. These actions include deep, rapid, and sustained mitigation efforts, which can reduce future adaptation costs, losses, and damages, and enhance sustainable development co-benefits. However, these actions require higher up-front investments and disruptive changes, which can be moderated by enabling conditions and the removal or reduction of barriers to feasibility.  The text also highlights the benefits of near-term adaptation responses, which can bring significant benefits to human well-being, especially for vulnerable populations. Limiting global warming to close to 1.5°C can substantially reduce projected losses and damages related to climate change, but cannot eliminate them all. Delayed mitigation action will further increase global warming, decreasing the effectiveness of many adaptation options and increasing mitigation feasibility risks.  The text also discusses the co-benefits of mitigation actions, such as improved air quality and human health, which can have significant economic benefits. However, there are challenges associated with delayed adaptation and mitigation actions, including the risk of cost escalation, lock-in of infrastructure, stranded assets, and reduced feasibility and effectiveness of adaptation and mitigation options.  To address these challenges, the text suggests scaling-up near-term climate actions, which can generate disruptive changes in economic structure but can be offset by deeper fiscal, financial, institutional, and regulatory reforms. Enabling conditions and reducing barriers to feasibility are also essential to realizing opportunities for deep and rapid adaptation and mitigation actions and climate resilient development. The text emphasizes the importance of equity and inclusion in climate action, rapid and far-reaching transitions in sectors and systems, measures to achieve synergies and reduce trade-offs with sustainable development goals, governance and policy improvements, access to finance, improved international cooperation and technology improvements, and integration of near-term actions across sectors, systems, and regions.</s>  The text discusses the near-term risks of climate change, which include increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events, biodiversity loss, and health risks. These risks will be more pronounced in regions with high vulnerability and exposure, particularly in low-lying areas and for marginalized populations. Natural variability can modulate human-induced climate change, but its impact on regional scales is important to consider in adaptation planning. By 2030, there is a significant probability that global surface temperature will exceed 1.5°C relative to pre-industrial levels in any given year. Adaptation can help mitigate some of these risks, but losses and damages will continue to increase with every increment of global warming. The text also highlights the importance of addressing the root causes of vulnerability, such as unsustainable development patterns and socio-economic inequality.

Text: The text emphasizes the importance of accelerating both adaptation and mitigation actions to address climate change, with a focus on near-term actions. These actions bring co-benefits, such as improved air quality and human health, and reducing future adaptation costs and losses. However, there are challenges to implementing these actions, including the need for higher up-front investments and disruptive changes. Delayed actions can lead to increased costs, stranded assets, and reduced feasibility and effectiveness of adaptation and mitigation options.  The text also highlights the importance of equity and inclusion in climate action, and the need for deeper fiscal, financial, institutional, and regulatory reforms to offset any adverse effects. Enabling conditions, such as access to finance, improved international cooperation, and technology improvements, need to be strengthened to realize opportunities for deep and rapid adaptation and mitigation actions. Barriers to feasibility, such as economic, technological, institutional, social, environmental, and geophysical barriers, need to be addressed to deploy mitigation and adaptation options at scale. Integrating ambitious climate actions with macroeconomic policies can provide benefits, including improved sustainable low-emission economic recovery, development, and job creation programs, safety nets and social protection in the transition, and broadened access to finance, technology, and capacity-building.</s>  The text discusses the significant mitigation and adaptation potential in agriculture, forestry, and other land use, as well as in the oceans. The largest economic mitigation potential comes from the conservation, improved management, and restoration of forests and other ecosystems, particularly reduced deforestation in tropical regions. Ecosystem restoration, reforestation, and afforestation can lead to trade-offs, so integrated approaches are necessary to meet multiple objectives, including food security.  Demand-side measures and sustainable agricultural intensification can reduce emissions and free up land for reforestation and ecosystem restoration. Sustainably sourced agriculture and forest products can replace more GHG-intensive products in other sectors. Effective adaptation options include cultivar improvements, agroforestry, community-based adaptation, farm and landscape diversification, and urban agriculture.  Maintaining the resilience of biodiversity and ecosystem services requires the conservation of approximately 30-50% of Earth's land, freshwater, and ocean areas. Ecosystem-based adaptation and most water-related adaptation options become less effective with increasing warming. Some options, such as conservation of high-carbon ecosystems, have immediate impacts, while others take decades to deliver measurable results. Many sustainable land management technologies and practices are financially profitable in three to ten years.  Cooperation and inclusive decision-making with local communities and Indigenous Peoples are integral to successful adaptation across forests and other ecosystems. Natural rivers, wetlands, and upstream forests reduce flood risk, and enhancing natural water retention can further reduce flood risk. Protection and restoration of coastal 'blue carbon' ecosystems can reduce emissions and increase carbon uptake and storage. Coastal wetlands protect against coastal erosion and flooding, and strengthening precautionary approaches in fisheries management reduces negative climate change impacts. Ecosystem-based management in fisheries and aquaculture supports food security, biodiversity, human health and well-being.  Large-scale land conversion for bioenergy, biochar, or afforestation can increase risks to biodiversity, water, and food security. In contrast, restoring natural forests and drained peatlands, and improving sustainability of managed forests, enhances the resilience of carbon stocks and sinks and reduces ecosystem vulnerability to climate change.</s>  The text emphasizes the importance of integrating health considerations into various policies related to food, infrastructure, social protection, and water to achieve co-benefits for human health and the environment. The text highlights the opportunities presented by balanced and sustainable diets, reduced food loss and waste, and public health policies to improve nutrition. Additionally, the text discusses the benefits of improved access to clean energy sources, active mobility, and public transport. The text also mentions the effectiveness of Health Action Plans, including early warning and response systems, in protecting human health from extreme heat, water-borne and food-borne diseases, and vector-borne diseases. The text stresses the importance of universal access to healthcare as a key pathway to climate resilience in the health sector.</s>  The text discusses the co-benefits of adaptation and mitigation actions in relation to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The main takeaways are:  1. Mitigation and adaptation actions have more synergies than trade-offs with SDGs, but the synergies and trade-offs depend on the context and scale of implementation. 2. Several mitigation and adaptation options have multiple synergies with SDGs, such as clean energy supply systems, heat health action plans, sustainable land use and urban planning, electrification, and conservation and restoration of ecosystems. 3. Social safety nets and land restoration have strong co-benefits with development goals and can help minimize trade-offs. 4. Effective governance is needed to limit trade-offs of some mitigation options and ensure adequate institutional capacity at all levels. 5. Different contexts require different approaches to implementation, and countries at all stages of economic development can achieve sustainable development while minimizing emissions growth. 6. Co-benefits and synergies can be realized by giving emphasis to capacity building, finance, technology transfer, investments, and meaningful participation of Indigenous Peoples, local communities, and vulnerable populations. 7. Transitioning from incremental to transformational adaptation can help overcome soft adaptation limits for individuals and households in low-lying coastal areas, Small Islands, and smallholder farmers. 8. Policies promoting economic and energy sector diversification and considerations of just transitions principles are necessary for regions highly dependent on fossil fuels.</s>  [/INST]","The text emphasizes the importance of taking urgent action to address climate change through both adaptation and mitigation, highlighting the co-benefits of improved air quality, human health, and reduced future costs.

Text: Industry  There are several options to reduce industrial emissions that differ by type of industry; many industries are disrupted by climate change, especially from extreme events . Reducing industry emissions will entail coordinated action throughout value chains to promote all mitigation options, including demand management, energy and materials efficiency, circular material flows, as well as abatement technologies and transformational changes in production processes. Light industry and manufacturing can be largely decarbonized through available abatement technologies, electrification, and switching to low- and zero-GHG emitting fuels  , while deep reduction of cement process emissions will rely on cementitious material substitution and the availability of Carbon Capture and Storage until new chemistries are mastered. Reducing emissions from the production and use of chemicals would need to rely on a life cycle approach, including increased plastics recycling, fuel and feedstock switching, and carbon sourced through biogenic sources, and, depending on availability, Carbon Capture and Utilisation, direct air CO2 capture, as well as CCS. Action to reduce industry sector emissions may change the location of GHG-intensive industries and the organisation of value chains, with distributional effects on employment and economic structure.  Many industrial and service sectors are negatively affected by climate change through supply and operational disruptions, especially from extreme events, and will require adaptation efforts. Water intensive industries can undertake measures to reduce water stress, such as water recycling and reuse, using brackish or saline sources, working to improve water use efficiency. However, residual risks will remain, especially at higher levels of warming . Cities, Settlements and Infrastructure  Urban systems are critical for achieving deep emissions reductions and advancing climate resilient development, particularly when this involves integrated planning that incorporates physical, natural and social infrastructure . Deep emissions reductions and integrated adaptation actions are advanced by: integrated, inclusive land use planning and decision-making; compact urban form by co-locating jobs and housing; reducing or changing urban energy and material consumption; electrification in combination with low emissions sources; improved water and waste management infrastructure; and enhancing carbon uptake and storage in the urban environment . Cities can achieve net zero emissions if emissions are reduced within and outside of their administrative boundaries through supply chains, creating beneficial cascading effects across other sectors.  Considering climate change impacts and risks  in the design and planning of urban and rural settlements and infrastructure is critical for resilience and enhancing human well-being. Effective mitigation can be advanced at each of the design, construction, retrofit, use and disposal stages for buildings. Mitigation interventions for buildings include: at the construction phase, lowemission construction materials, highly efficient building envelope and the integration of renewable energy solutions; at the use phase, highly efficient appliances/equipment, the optimisation of the use of buildings and their supply with low-emission energy sources; and at the disposal phase, recycling and re-using construction materials. Sufficiency 155 measures can limit the demand for energy and materials over the lifecycle of buildings and appliances.   Transport-related GHG emissions can be reduced by demand-side options and low-GHG emissions technologies. Changes in urban form, reallocation of street space for cycling and walking, digitalisation and programs that encourage changes in consumer behaviour can reduce demand for transport services and support the shift to more energy efficient transport modes. Electric vehicles powered by low-emissions electricity offer the largest decarbonisation potential for land-based transport, on a life cycle basis. Costs of electrified vehicles are decreasing and their adoption is accelerating, but they require continued investments in supporting infrastructure to increase scale of deployment. The environmental footprint of battery production and growing concerns about critical minerals can be addressed by material and supply diversification strategies, energy and material efficiency improvements, and circular material flows . Advances in battery technologies could facilitate the electrification of heavy-duty trucks and compliment conventional electric rail systems. Sustainable biofuels can offer additional mitigation benefits in land-based transport in the short and medium term. Sustainable biofuels, low-emissions hydrogen, and derivatives can support mitigation of CO2 emissions from shipping, aviation, and heavy-duty land transport but require production process improvements and cost reductions. Key infrastructure systems including sanitation, water, health, transport, communications and energy will be increasingly vulnerable if design standards do not account for changing climate conditions.  Green/natural and blue infrastructure such as urban forestry, green roofs, ponds and lakes, and river restoration can mitigate climate change through carbon uptake and storage, avoided emissions, and reduced energy use while reducing risk from extreme events such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation and droughts, and advancing co-benefits for health, well-being and livelihoods. Urban greening can provide local cooling. Combining green/natural and grey/physical infrastructure adaptation responses has potential to reduce adaptation costs and contribute to flood control, sanitation, water resources management, landslide prevention and coastal protection. Globally, more financing is directed at grey/physical infrastructure than green/natural infrastructure and social infrastructure, and there is limited evidence of investment in informal settlements . The greatest gains in well-being in urban areas can be achieved by prioritising finance to reduce climate risk for low-income and marginalised communities including people living in informal settlements.

[/INST]","The text discusses various strategies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in industries, urban systems, and other sectors. The main takeaways are:

1. Industries: Reducing industrial emissions requires a coordinated approach throughout value chains, involving demand management, energy and materials efficiency, circular material flows, and abatement technologies. Light industries can decarbonize through available technologies, while deep reductions in cement process emissions will rely on substitution and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS).
2. Urban systems: Urban planning plays a crucial role in achieving deep emissions reductions and climate resilient development. Integrated planning, compact urban form, electrification, improved water and waste management infrastructure, and carbon uptake and storage in the urban environment are essential.
3. Sufficiency: Measures to limit the demand for energy and materials over the lifecycle of buildings and appliances can significantly reduce emissions.
4. Transport: Demand-side options and low-GHG emissions technologies, such as electric vehicles and sustainable biofuels, can reduce transport-related emissions.
5. Green/natural and blue infrastructure: Urban greening, such as urban forestry, green roofs, and river restoration, can mitigate climate change through carbon uptake and storage, avoided emissions, and reduced energy use.
6. Financing: There is a need for more financing for green/natural infrastructure and social infrastructure, and prioritizing finance for low-income and marginalized communities can achieve the greatest gains in well-being in urban areas.
7.

Text: Cities, Settlements and Infrastructure  Urban systems are critical for achieving deep emissions reductions and advancing climate resilient development, particularly when this involves integrated planning that incorporates physical, natural and social infrastructure . Deep emissions reductions and integrated adaptation actions are advanced by: integrated, inclusive land use planning and decision-making; compact urban form by co-locating jobs and housing; reducing or changing urban energy and material consumption; electrification in combination with low emissions sources; improved water and waste management infrastructure; and enhancing carbon uptake and storage in the urban environment . Cities can achieve net zero emissions if emissions are reduced within and outside of their administrative boundaries through supply chains, creating beneficial cascading effects across other sectors.  Considering climate change impacts and risks  in the design and planning of urban and rural settlements and infrastructure is critical for resilience and enhancing human well-being. Effective mitigation can be advanced at each of the design, construction, retrofit, use and disposal stages for buildings. Mitigation interventions for buildings include: at the construction phase, lowemission construction materials, highly efficient building envelope and the integration of renewable energy solutions; at the use phase, highly efficient appliances/equipment, the optimisation of the use of buildings and their supply with low-emission energy sources; and at the disposal phase, recycling and re-using construction materials. Sufficiency 155 measures can limit the demand for energy and materials over the lifecycle of buildings and appliances.   Transport-related GHG emissions can be reduced by demand-side options and low-GHG emissions technologies. Changes in urban form, reallocation of street space for cycling and walking, digitalisation and programs that encourage changes in consumer behaviour can reduce demand for transport services and support the shift to more energy efficient transport modes. Electric vehicles powered by low-emissions electricity offer the largest decarbonisation potential for land-based transport, on a life cycle basis. Costs of electrified vehicles are decreasing and their adoption is accelerating, but they require continued investments in supporting infrastructure to increase scale of deployment. The environmental footprint of battery production and growing concerns about critical minerals can be addressed by material and supply diversification strategies, energy and material efficiency improvements, and circular material flows . Advances in battery technologies could facilitate the electrification of heavy-duty trucks and compliment conventional electric rail systems. Sustainable biofuels can offer additional mitigation benefits in land-based transport in the short and medium term. Sustainable biofuels, low-emissions hydrogen, and derivatives can support mitigation of CO2 emissions from shipping, aviation, and heavy-duty land transport but require production process improvements and cost reductions. Key infrastructure systems including sanitation, water, health, transport, communications and energy will be increasingly vulnerable if design standards do not account for changing climate conditions.  Green/natural and blue infrastructure such as urban forestry, green roofs, ponds and lakes, and river restoration can mitigate climate change through carbon uptake and storage, avoided emissions, and reduced energy use while reducing risk from extreme events such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation and droughts, and advancing co-benefits for health, well-being and livelihoods. Urban greening can provide local cooling. Combining green/natural and grey/physical infrastructure adaptation responses has potential to reduce adaptation costs and contribute to flood control, sanitation, water resources management, landslide prevention and coastal protection. Globally, more financing is directed at grey/physical infrastructure than green/natural infrastructure and social infrastructure, and there is limited evidence of investment in informal settlements . The greatest gains in well-being in urban areas can be achieved by prioritising finance to reduce climate risk for low-income and marginalised communities including people living in informal settlements.  Responses to ongoing sea level rise and land subsidence in low-lying coastal cities and settlements and small islands include protection, accommodation, advance and planned relocation. These responses are more effective if combined and/or sequenced, planned well ahead, aligned with sociocultural values and development priorities, and underpinned by inclusive community engagement processes.

Co-Benefits of Adaptation and Mitigation for Sustainable Development Goals  Mitigation and adaptation actions have more synergies than trade-offs with Sustainable Development Goals . Synergies and trade-offs depend on context and scale of implementation. Potential trade-offs can be compensated or avoided with additional policies, investments and financial partnerships. Many mitigation and adaptation actions have multiple synergies with Sustainable Development Goals, but some actions can also have trade-offs. Potential synergies with SDGs exceed potential trade-offs. Synergies and trade-offs are context specific and depend on: means and scale of implementation, intra- and inter-sectoral interactions, cooperation between countries and regions, the sequencing, timing and stringency of actions, governance, and policy design. Eradicating extreme poverty, energy poverty, and providing decent living standards to all, consistent with nearterm sustainable development objectives, can be achieved without significant global emissions growth.  Several mitigation and adaptation options can harness nearterm synergies and reduce trade-offs to advance sustainable development in energy, urban and land systems . Clean energy supply systems have multiple co-benefits, including improvements in air quality and health. Heat Health Action Plans that include early warning and response systems, approaches that mainstream health into food, livelihoods, social protection, water and sanitation benefit health and wellbeing. There are potential synergies between multiple Sustainable Development Goals and sustainable land use and urban planning with more green spaces, reduced air pollution, and demand-side mitigation including shifts to balanced, sustainable healthy diets. Electrification combined with low-GHG energy, and shifts to public transport can enhance health, employment, and can contribute to energy security and deliver equity. Conservation, protection and restoration of terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and ocean ecosystems, together with targeted management to adapt to unavoidable impacts of climate change can generate multiple additional benefits, such as agricultural productivity, food security, and biodiversity conservation.  When implementing mitigation and adaptation together, and taking trade-offs into account, multiple co-benefits and synergies for human well-being as well as ecosystem and planetary health can be realised. There is a strong link between sustainable development, vulnerability and climate risks. Social safety nets that support climate change adaptation have strong co-benefits with development goals such as education, poverty alleviation, gender inclusion and food security. Land restoration contributes to mitigation and adaptation with synergies via enhanced ecosystem services and with economically positive returns and co-benefits for poverty reduction and improved livelihoods. Trade-offs can be evaluated and minimised by giving emphasis to capacity building, finance, technology transfer, investments; governance, development, context specific gender-based and other social equity considerations with meaningful participation of Indigenous Peoples, local communities and vulnerable populations. .  Context relevant design and implementation requires considering people’s needs, biodiversity, and other sustainable development dimensions. Countries at all stages of economic development seek to improve the well-being of people, and their development priorities reflect different starting points and contexts. Different contexts include but are not limited to social, economic, environmental, cultural, or political circumstances, resource endowment, capabilities, international environment, and prior development. n regions with high dependency on fossil fuels for, among other things, revenue and employment generation, mitigating risks for sustainable development requires policies that promote economic and energy sector diversification and considerations of just transitions principles, processes and practices. For individuals and households in low-lying coastal areas, in Small Islands, and smallholder farmers transitioning from incremental to transformational adaptation can help overcome soft adaptation limits.

Text: Society, Livelihoods, and Economies  Enhancing knowledge on risks and available adaptation options promotes societal responses, and behaviour and lifestyle changes supported by policies, infrastructure and technology can help reduce global GHG emissions. Climate literacy and information provided through climate services and community approaches, including those that are informed by Indigenous Knowledge and local knowledge, can accelerate behavioural changes and planning . Educational and information programmes, using the arts, participatory modelling and citizen science can facilitate awareness, heighten risk perception, and influence behaviours . The way choices are presented can enable adoption of low GHG intensive socio-cultural options, such as shifts to balanced, sustainable healthy diets, reduced food waste, and active mobility. Judicious labelling, framing, and communication of social norms can increase the effect of mandates, subsidies, or taxes.  A range of adaptation options, such as disaster risk management, early warning systems, climate services and risk spreading and sharing approaches, have broad applicability across sectors and provide greater risk reduction benefits when combined . Climate services that are demand-driven and inclusive of different users and providers can improve agricultural practices, inform better water use and efficiency, and enable resilient infrastructure planning. Policy mixes that include weather and health insurance, social protection and adaptive safety nets, contingent finance and reserve funds, and universal access to early warning systems combined with effective contingency plans, can reduce vulnerability and exposure of human systems. Integrating climate adaptation into social protection programs, including cash transfers and public works programs, is highly feasible and increases resilience to climate change, especially when supported by basic services and infrastructure. Social safety nets can build adaptive capacities, reduce socioeconomic vulnerability, and reduce risk linked to hazards.  Reducing future risks of involuntary migration and displacement due to climate change is possible through cooperative, international efforts to enhance institutional adaptive capacity and sustainable development. Increasing adaptive capacity minimises risk associated with involuntary migration and immobility and improves the degree of choice under which migration decisions are made, while policy interventions can remove barriers and expand the alternatives for safe, orderly and regular migration that allows vulnerable people to adapt to climate change.  Accelerating commitment and follow-through by the private sector is promoted for instance by building business cases for adaptation, accountability and transparency mechanisms, and monitoring and evaluation of adaptation progress . Integrated pathways for managing climate risks will be most suitable when so-called ‘low-regret’ anticipatory options are established jointly across sectors in a timely manner and are feasible and effective in their local context, and when path dependencies and maladaptations across sectors are avoided. Sustained adaptation actions are strengthened by mainstreaming adaptation into institutional budget and policy planning cycles, statutory planning, monitoring and evaluation frameworks and into recovery efforts from disaster events.

Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods like reforestation and improved forest management can enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functions, but large-scale afforestation or production of biomass crops for bioenergy can have adverse socio-economic and environmental impacts.  The text also mentions that modelled pathways towards sustainability have fewer challenges and more pronounced synergies with sustainable development. Strengthening climate change mitigation action brings benefits from avoiding damages and reduced adaptation costs, but requires more rapid transitions and higher up-front investments. The economic effects of mitigation action vary across regions and countries, and ambitious mitigation pathways imply large and disruptive changes.  The text also notes that cost-benefit analysis has limitations in representing all damages from climate change or capturing the heterogeneous nature of damages and the risk of catastrophic damages. However, the benefits of limiting warming to 2°C exceed the cost of mitigation, and limiting warming to 1.5°C instead of 2°C would increase the costs but also increase the benefits. The text also mentions the potential strong economic benefits of air quality improvement and the importance of considering other sustainable development dimensions.</s>  The text discusses the synergies between mitigation and adaptation actions and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The authors argue that while there are potential trade-offs, the synergies outweigh them and are context-specific. Several mitigation and adaptation actions have multiple co-benefits for SDGs, such as improving air quality, reducing energy poverty, and promoting sustainable land use. For example, clean energy supply systems, heat health action plans, and electrification can enhance health, employment, and contribute to energy security. Conservation and restoration of ecosystems can generate multiple benefits, such as agricultural productivity and biodiversity conservation. The text also emphasizes the importance of effective governance and financing to minimize trade-offs and maximize co-benefits. The authors argue that social safety nets and land restoration can have strong co-benefits with development goals. The text concludes that when implementing mitigation and adaptation together, multiple co-benefits and synergies for human well-being and ecosystem health can be achieved. The text also acknowledges the challenges of implementing mitigation and adaptation in different contexts, such as high dependency on fossil fuels and vulnerability to climate risks.</s>  The text emphasizes the importance of integrating climate mitigation and adaptation actions across sectors and systems to achieve greater benefits for human well-being, social equity and justice, and ecosystem and planetary health. Climate resilient development strategies that treat climate, ecosystems, and biodiversity as an integrated system are more effective. Synergies with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can enhance prospects for climate resilient development. Multi-sectoral solutions provide opportunities for multiple and large-scale benefits and avoided damages in the near term. Integrated design approaches to construction and retrofit of buildings, as well as integrated transport and energy infrastructure planning and operations, can reduce the environmental, social, and economic impacts of decarbonizing sectors. Mitigation and adaptation actions implemented together can yield multiple benefits for human well-being and ecosystem health. Effective action will require political commitment, social cooperation, finance, and more integrated cross-sectoral policies and support. Examples of positive interactions include AFOLU mitigation actions in land-use change and forestry, which can provide large-scale GHG emission reductions and removals while benefiting biodiversity, food security, wood supply, and other ecosystem services. Adaptation measures in land, ocean, and ecosystems can have widespread benefits for food security, nutrition, health, and well-being, ecosystems, and biodiversity. Urban policies that implement multiple interventions can yield adaptation or mitigation gains with equity and human well-being. Coordinated cross-sectoral policies and planning can maximize synergies and avoid or reduce trade-offs between mitigation and adaptation. Trade-offs in terms of employment, water use, land-use competition, and biodiversity can be avoided by well-implemented land-based mitigation options.</s>  [/INST]","The text discusses the synergies between climate change mitigation and adaptation actions and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Text: Equity and Inclusion in Climate Change Action  Actions that prioritise equity, climate justice, social justice and inclusion lead to more sustainable outcomes, co-benefits, reduce trade-offs, support transformative change and advance climate resilient development. Adaptation responses are immediately needed to reduce rising climate risks, especially for the most vulnerable. Equity, inclusion and just transitions are key to progress on adaptation and deeper societal ambitions for accelerated mitigation. Adaptation and mitigation actions, across scales, sectors and regions, that prioritise equity, climate justice, rights-based approaches, social justice and inclusivity, lead to more sustainable outcomes, reduce trade-offs, support transformative change and advance climate resilient development . Redistributive policies across sectors and regions that shield the poor and vulnerable, social safety nets, equity, inclusion and just transitions, at all scales can enable deeper societal ambitions and resolve trade-offs with sustainable development goals., particularly education, hunger, poverty, gender and energy access . Mitigation efforts embedded within the wider development context can increase the pace, depth and breadth of emission reductions . Equity, inclusion and just transitions at all scales enable deeper societal ambitions for accelerated mitigation, and climate action more broadly. The complexity in risk of rising food prices, reduced household incomes, and health and climate-related malnutrition  and mortality increases with little or low levels of adaptation.  Regions and people with considerable development constraints have high vulnerability to climatic hazards. Adaptation outcomes for the most vulnerable within and across countries and regions are enhanced through approaches focusing on equity, inclusivity, and rights-based approaches, including 3.3 to 3.6 billion people living in contexts that are highly vulnerable to climate change. Vulnerability is higher in locations with poverty, governance challenges and limited access to basic services and resources, violent conflict and high levels of climate-sensitive livelihoods  . Several risks can be moderated with adaptation. The largest adaptation gaps exist among lower income population groups and adaptation progress is unevenly distributed with observed adaptation gaps. Present development challenges causing high vulnerability are influenced by historical and ongoing patterns of inequity such as colonialism, especially for many Indigenous Peoples and local communities. Vulnerability is exacerbated by inequity and marginalisation linked to gender, ethnicity, low income or combinations thereof, especially for many Indigenous Peoples and local communities.  Meaningful participation and inclusive planning, informed by cultural values, Indigenous Knowledge, local knowledge, and scientific knowledge can help address adaptation gaps and avoid maladaptation. Such actions with flexible pathways may encourage low-regret and timely actions . Integrating climate adaptation into social protection programmes, including cash transfers and public works programmes, would increase resilience to climate change, especially when supported by basic services and infrastructure.  Equity, inclusion, just transitions, broad and meaningful participation of all relevant actors in decision making at all scales enable deeper societal ambitions for accelerated mitigation, and climate action more broadly, and build social trust, support transformative changes and an equitable sharing of benefits and burdens. Equity remains a central element in the UN climate regime, notwithstanding shifts in differentiation between states over time and challenges in assessing fair shares. Ambitious mitigation pathways imply large and sometimes disruptive changes in economic structure, with significant distributional consequences, within and between countries, including shifting of income and employment during the transition from high to low emissions activities. While some jobs may be lost, low-emissions development can also open up opportunities to enhance skills and create jobs. Broadening equitable access to finance, technologies and governance that facilitate mitigation, and consideration of climate justice can help equitable sharing of benefits and burdens, especially for vulnerable countries and communities.  Development priorities among countries also reflect different starting points and contexts, and enabling conditions for shifting development pathways towards increased sustainability will therefore differ, giving rise to different needs . Implementing just transition principles through collective and participatory decision-making processes is an effective way of integrating equity principles into policies at all scales depending on national circumstances, while in several countries just transition commissions, task forces and national policies have been established .  Many economic and regulatory instruments have been effective in reducing emissions and practical experience has informed instrument design to improve them while addressing distributional goals and social acceptance. The design of behavioural interventions, including the way that choices are presented to consumers work synergistically with price signals, making the combination more effective. Individuals with high socio-economic status contribute disproportionately to emissions, and have the highest potential for emissions reductions, e.g., as citizens, investors, consumers, role models, and professionals . There are options on design of instruments such as taxes, subsidies, prices, and consumption-based approaches, complemented by regulatory instruments to reduce high-emissions consumption while improving equity and societal well-being. Behaviour and lifestyle changes to help end-users adopt low-GHG-intensive options can be supported by policies, infrastructure and technology with multiple co-benefits for societal well-being. Broadening equitable access to domestic and international finance, technologies and capacity can also act as a catalyst for accelerating mitigation and shifting development pathways in low-income contexts . Eradicating extreme poverty, energy poverty, and providing decent living standards to all in these regions in the context of achieving sustainable development objectives, in the near term, can be achieved without significant global emissions growth. Technology development, transfer, capacity building and financing can support developing countries/ regions leapfrogging or transitioning to low-emissions transport systems thereby providing multiple co-benefits .

This can be accomplished through integrated planning that incorporates physical, natural, and social infrastructure. Key strategies include:  1. Integrated, inclusive land use planning and decision-making 2. Compact urban form with co-located jobs and housing 3. Reducing or changing urban energy and material consumption 4. Electrification in combination with low emissions sources 5. Improved water and waste management infrastructure 6. Enhancing carbon uptake and storage in the urban environment  Cities can achieve net zero emissions by reducing emissions within and outside their administrative boundaries. Considering climate change impacts and risks in the design and planning of urban and rural settlements and infrastructure is critical for resilience and enhancing human well-being.  Mitigation interventions for buildings include low-emission construction materials, efficient building envelopes, renewable energy solutions, efficient appliances/equipment, and optimizing building use with low-emission energy sources. Sufficiency measures can limit the demand for energy and materials over the lifecycle of buildings and appliances.  Transport-related GHG emissions can be reduced through demand-side options and low-GHG emissions technologies. Electric vehicles powered by low-emissions electricity offer the largest decarbonisation potential for land-based transport. Advances in battery technologies could facilitate the electrification of heavy-duty trucks and complement conventional electric rail systems. Sustainable biofuels can offer additional mitigation benefits in land-based transport in the short and medium term.  Key infrastructure systems including sanitation, water, health, transport, communications, and energy will be increasingly vulnerable if design standards do not account for changing climate conditions. Green/natural and blue infrastructure such as urban forestry, green roofs, ponds and lakes, and river restoration can mitigate climate change and reduce risk from extreme events. Urban greening can provide local cooling. Combining green/natural and grey/physical infrastructure adaptation responses can reduce adaptation costs and contribute to flood control, sanitation, water resources management, landslide prevention, and coastal protection.  Financing for green/natural and social infrastructure and informal settlements is limited, and the greatest gains in well-being in urban areas can be achieved by prioritizing finance to reduce climate risk for low-income and marginalized communities. Responses to ongoing sea level rise and land subsidence in low-lying coastal cities and settlements and small islands include protection, accommodation, advance and planned relocation. These responses are more effective if combined and/or sequenced, planned well ahead, aligned with sociocultural values and development priorities, and underpinned by inclusive community engagement processes.</s>  The text emphasizes the importance of integrating health into various policies to address both adaptation and mitigation of climate change. The following are the main takeaways:  1. Balanced and sustainable healthy diets, reduced food loss, and waste can benefit human health, biodiversity, and reduce healthcare costs and greenhouse gas emissions. 2. Public health policies, such as increasing food diversity in public procurement and awareness-raising campaigns, can influence food demand, reduce food waste, and improve nutrition. 3. Improved access to clean energy sources and technologies, and shifts to active mobility and public transport can deliver socioeconomic, air quality, and health benefits, especially for women and children. 4. Effective adaptation options exist to protect human health and well-being, including early warning and response systems for extreme heat, improving access to potable water, reducing exposure of water and sanitation systems to flooding and extreme weather events, and surveillance, early warning systems, and vaccine development for vector-borne diseases. 5. Improving surveillance and access to mental health care, and monitoring of psychosocial impacts from extreme weather events are effective adaptation options for reducing mental health risks under climate change. 6.

Text: Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution  Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals. Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related losses and damages to nature and people. Vulnerable communities who have historically contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected. Equity and Inclusion in Climate Change Action  Actions that prioritise equity, climate justice, social justice and inclusion lead to more sustainable outcomes, co-benefits, reduce trade-offs, support transformative change and advance climate resilient development. Adaptation responses are immediately needed to reduce rising climate risks, especially for the most vulnerable. Equity, inclusion and just transitions are key to progress on adaptation and deeper societal ambitions for accelerated mitigation. Adaptation and mitigation actions, across scales, sectors and regions, that prioritise equity, climate justice, rights-based approaches, social justice and inclusivity, lead to more sustainable outcomes, reduce trade-offs, support transformative change and advance climate resilient development . Redistributive policies across sectors and regions that shield the poor and vulnerable, social safety nets, equity, inclusion and just transitions, at all scales can enable deeper societal ambitions and resolve trade-offs with sustainable development goals., particularly education, hunger, poverty, gender and energy access . Mitigation efforts embedded within the wider development context can increase the pace, depth and breadth of emission reductions . Equity, inclusion and just transitions at all scales enable deeper societal ambitions for accelerated mitigation, and climate action more broadly. The complexity in risk of rising food prices, reduced household incomes, and health and climate-related malnutrition  and mortality increases with little or low levels of adaptation.  Regions and people with considerable development constraints have high vulnerability to climatic hazards. Adaptation outcomes for the most vulnerable within and across countries and regions are enhanced through approaches focusing on equity, inclusivity, and rights-based approaches, including 3.3 to 3.6 billion people living in contexts that are highly vulnerable to climate change. Vulnerability is higher in locations with poverty, governance challenges and limited access to basic services and resources, violent conflict and high levels of climate-sensitive livelihoods  . Several risks can be moderated with adaptation. The largest adaptation gaps exist among lower income population groups and adaptation progress is unevenly distributed with observed adaptation gaps. Present development challenges causing high vulnerability are influenced by historical and ongoing patterns of inequity such as colonialism, especially for many Indigenous Peoples and local communities. Vulnerability is exacerbated by inequity and marginalisation linked to gender, ethnicity, low income or combinations thereof, especially for many Indigenous Peoples and local communities.  Meaningful participation and inclusive planning, informed by cultural values, Indigenous Knowledge, local knowledge, and scientific knowledge can help address adaptation gaps and avoid maladaptation. Such actions with flexible pathways may encourage low-regret and timely actions . Integrating climate adaptation into social protection programmes, including cash transfers and public works programmes, would increase resilience to climate change, especially when supported by basic services and infrastructure.  Equity, inclusion, just transitions, broad and meaningful participation of all relevant actors in decision making at all scales enable deeper societal ambitions for accelerated mitigation, and climate action more broadly, and build social trust, support transformative changes and an equitable sharing of benefits and burdens. Equity remains a central element in the UN climate regime, notwithstanding shifts in differentiation between states over time and challenges in assessing fair shares. Ambitious mitigation pathways imply large and sometimes disruptive changes in economic structure, with significant distributional consequences, within and between countries, including shifting of income and employment during the transition from high to low emissions activities. While some jobs may be lost, low-emissions development can also open up opportunities to enhance skills and create jobs. Broadening equitable access to finance, technologies and governance that facilitate mitigation, and consideration of climate justice can help equitable sharing of benefits and burdens, especially for vulnerable countries and communities.  Development priorities among countries also reflect different starting points and contexts, and enabling conditions for shifting development pathways towards increased sustainability will therefore differ, giving rise to different needs . Implementing just transition principles through collective and participatory decision-making processes is an effective way of integrating equity principles into policies at all scales depending on national circumstances, while in several countries just transition commissions, task forces and national policies have been established .  Many economic and regulatory instruments have been effective in reducing emissions and practical experience has informed instrument design to improve them while addressing distributional goals and social acceptance. The design of behavioural interventions, including the way that choices are presented to consumers work synergistically with price signals, making the combination more effective. Individuals with high socio-economic status contribute disproportionately to emissions, and have the highest potential for emissions reductions, e.g., as citizens, investors, consumers, role models, and professionals . There are options on design of instruments such as taxes, subsidies, prices, and consumption-based approaches, complemented by regulatory instruments to reduce high-emissions consumption while improving equity and societal well-being. Behaviour and lifestyle changes to help end-users adopt low-GHG-intensive options can be supported by policies, infrastructure and technology with multiple co-benefits for societal well-being. Broadening equitable access to domestic and international finance, technologies and capacity can also act as a catalyst for accelerating mitigation and shifting development pathways in low-income contexts . Eradicating extreme poverty, energy poverty, and providing decent living standards to all in these regions in the context of achieving sustainable development objectives, in the near term, can be achieved without significant global emissions growth. Technology development, transfer, capacity building and financing can support developing countries/ regions leapfrogging or transitioning to low-emissions transport systems thereby providing multiple co-benefits . Climate resilient development is advanced when actors work in equitable, just and enabling ways to reconcile divergent interests, values and worldviews, toward equitable and just outcomes .

Text: Responses Undertaken to Date  International climate agreements, rising national ambitions for climate action, along with rising public awareness are accelerating efforts to address climate change at multiple levels of governance. Mitigation policies have contributed to a decrease in global energy and carbon intensity, with several countries achieving GHG emission reductions for over a decade. Low-emission technologies are becoming more affordable, with many low or zero emissions options now available for energy, buildings, transport, and industry. Adaptation planning and implementation progress has generated multiple benefits, with effective adaptation options having the potential to reduce climate risks and contribute to sustainable development. Global tracked finance for mitigation and adaptation has seen an upward trend since AR5, but falls short of needs. Governance and Policy for Near-Term Climate Change Action  Effective climate action requires political commitment, well-aligned multi-level governance and institutional frameworks, laws, policies and strategies. It needs clear goals, adequate finance and financing tools, coordination across multiple policy domains, and inclusive governance processes. Many mitigation and adaptation policy instruments have been deployed successfully, and could support deep emissions reductions and climate resilience if scaled up and applied widely, depending on national circumstances. Adaptation and mitigation action benefits from drawing on diverse knowledge. Effective climate governance enables mitigation and adaptation by providing overall direction based on national circumstances, setting targets and priorities, mainstreaming climate action across policy domains and levels, based on national circumstances and in the context of international cooperation. Effective governance enhances monitoring and evaluation and regulatory certainty, prioritising inclusive, transparent and equitable decision-making, and improves access to finance and technology. These functions can be promoted by climate-relevant laws and plans, which are growing in number across sectors and regions, advancing mitigation outcomes and adaptation benefits . Climate laws have been growing in number and have helped deliver mitigation and adaptation outcomes .  Effective municipal, national and sub-national climate institutions, such as expert and co-ordinating bodies, enable co-produced, multi-scale decision-processes, build consensus for action among diverse interests, and inform strategy settings . This requires adequate institutional capacity at all levels. Vulnerabilities and climate risks are often reduced through carefully designed and implemented laws, policies, participatory processes, and interventions that address context specific inequities such as based on gender, ethnicity, disability, age, location and income. Policy support is influenced by Indigenous Peoples, businesses, and actors in civil society, including, youth, labour, media, and local communities, and effectiveness is enhanced by partnerships between many different groups in society . Climate-related litigation is growing, with a large number of cases in some developed countries and with a much smaller number in some developing countries, and in some cases has influenced the outcome and ambition of climate governance.  Effective climate governance is enabled by inclusive decision processes, allocation of appropriate resources, and institutional review, monitoring and evaluation. Multi-level, hybrid and cross-sector governance facilitates appropriate consideration for co-benefits and trade-offs, particularly in land sectors where decision processes range from farm level to national scale. Consideration of climate justice can help to facilitate shifting development pathways towards sustainability.  Drawing on diverse knowledge and partnerships, including with women, youth, Indigenous Peoples, local communities, and ethnic minorities can facilitate climate resilient development and has allowed locally appropriate and socially acceptable solutions.  Many regulatory and economic instruments have already been deployed successfully. These instruments could support deep emissions reductions if scaled up and applied more widely. Practical experience has informed instrument design and helped to improve predictability, environmental effectiveness, economic efficiency, and equity.  Scaling up and enhancing the use of regulatory instruments, consistent with national circumstances, can improve mitigation outcomes in sectoral applications, and regulatory instruments that include flexibility mechanisms can reduce costs of cutting emissions.  Where implemented, carbon pricing instruments have incentivized low-cost emissions reduction measures, but have been less effective, on their own and at prevailing prices during the assessment period, to promote higher-cost measures necessary for further reductions. Revenue from carbon taxes or emissions trading can be used for equity and distributional goals, for example to support low-income households, among other approaches. There is no consistent evidence that current emission trading systems have led to significant emissions leakage.  Removing fossil fuel subsidies would reduce emissions, improve public revenue and macroeconomic performance, and yield other environmental and sustainable development benefits such as improved public revenue, macroeconomic and sustainability performance; subsidy removal can have adverse distributional impacts especially on the most economically vulnerable groups which, in some cases, can be mitigated by measures such as re-distributing revenue saved, and depend on national circumstances. Fossil fuel subsidy removal is projected by various studies to reduce global CO 2 emissions by 1–4%, and GHG emissions by up to 10% by 2030, varying across regions .  National policies to support technology development, and participation in international markets for emission reduction, can bring positive spillover effects for other countries , although reduced demand for fossil fuels as a result of climate policy could result in costs to exporting countries . Economy-wide packages can meet short-term economic goals while reducing emissions and shifting development pathways towards sustainability. Examples are public spending commitments; pricing reforms; and investment in education and training, R&D and infrastructure. Effective policy packages would be comprehensive in coverage, harnessed to a clear vision for change, balanced across objectives, aligned with specific technology and system needs, consistent in terms of design and tailored to national circumstances .

Text: Technology Innovation, Adoption, Diffusion and  Transfer Enhancing technology innovation systems can provide opportunities to lower emissions growth and create social and environmental co-benefits. Policy packages tailored to national contexts and technological characteristics have been effective in supporting low-emission innovation and technology diffusion. Support for successful low-carbon technological innovation includes public policies such as training and R&D, complemented by regulatory and market-based instruments that create incentives and market opportunities such as appliance performance standards and building codes.  International cooperation on innovation systems and technology development and transfer, accompanied by capacity building, knowledge sharing, and technical and financial support can accelerate the global diffusion of mitigation technologies, practices and policies and align these with other development objectives. Choice architecture can help end-users adopt technology and low-GHG-intensive options. Adoption of low-emission technologies lags in most developing countries, particularly least developed ones, due in part to weaker enabling conditions, including limited finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity building.  International cooperation on innovation works best when tailored to and beneficial for local value chains, when partners collaborate on an equal footing, and when capacity building is an integral part of the effort.  Technological innovation can have trade-offs that include externalities such as new and greater environmental impacts and social inequalities; rebound effects leading to lower net emission reductions or even emission increases; and overdependence on foreign knowledge and providers. Appropriately designed policies and governance have helped address distributional impacts and rebound effects. For example, digital technologies can promote large increases in energy efficiency through coordination and an economic shift to services. However, societal digitalization can induce greater consumption of goods and energy and increased electronic waste as well as negatively impacting labour markets and worsening inequalities between and within countries. Digitalisation requires appropriate governance and policies in order to enhance mitigation potential. Effective policy packages can help to realise synergies, avoid trade-offs and/or reduce rebound effects: these might include a mix of efficiency targets, performance standards, information provision, carbon pricing, finance and technical assistance .  Technology transfer to expand use of digital technologies for land use monitoring, sustainable land management, and improved agricultural productivity supports reduced emissions from deforestation and land use change while also improving GHG accounting and standardisation . [/INST]","The text discusses the role of technological innovation in reducing emissions and achieving co-benefits for social and environmental sustainability. The following are the key takeaways:
