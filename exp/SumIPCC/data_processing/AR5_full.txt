1.1.1 Atmosphere
Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at
the Earth’s surface than any preceding decade since 1850. The
period from 1983 to 2012 was very likely the warmest 30-year period
of the last 800 years in the Northern Hemisphere, where such assess-
ment is possible (high confidence) and likely the warmest 30-year
period of the last 1400 years (medium confidence). {WGI 2.4.3, 5.3.5}
The globally averaged combined land and ocean surface temperature
data as calculated by a linear trend show a warming of 0.85 [0.65
to 1.06] °C20 over the period 1880 to 2012, for which multiple inde-
pendently produced datasets exist. The total increase between the
average of the 1850–1900 period and the 2003–2012 period is 0.78
[0.72 to 0.85] °C, based on the single longest dataset available. For the
longest period when calculation of regional trends is sufficiently com-
plete (1901 to 2012), almost the entire globe has experienced surface
warming (Figure 1.1). {WGI SPM B.1, 2.4.3}
In addition to robust multi-decadal warming, the globally averaged
surface temperature exhibits substantial decadal and interannual vari-
ability (Figure 1.1). Due to this natural variability, trends based on short
records are very sensitive to the beginning and end dates and do not
in general reflect long-term climate trends. As one example, the rate
of warming over the past 15 years (1998–2012; 0.05 [–0.05 to 0.15]
°C per decade), which begins with a strong El Niño, is smaller than
the rate calculated since 1951 (1951–2012; 0.12 [0.08 to 0.14] °C per
decade; see Box 1.1). {WGI SPM B.1, 2.4.3}
Based on multiple independent analyses of measurements, it is virtu-
ally certain that globally the troposphere has warmed and the lower
stratosphere has cooled since the mid-20th century. There is medium
confidence in the rate of change and its vertical structure in the North-
ern Hemisphere extratropical troposphere. {WGI SPM B.1, 2.4.4}
Confidence in precipitation change averaged over global land areas
since 1901 is low prior to 1951 and medium afterwards. Averaged over
the mid-latitude land areas of the Northern Hemisphere, precipitation
has likely increased since 1901 (medium confidence before and high
confidence after 1951). For other latitudes area-averaged long-term
positive or negative trends have low confidence (Figure 1.1). {WGI
SPM B.1, Figure SPM.2, 2.5.1}

1.1.2 Ocean
Ocean warming dominates the increase in energy stored in the
climate system, accounting for more than 90% of the energy
accumulated between 1971 and 2010 (high confidence) with
only about 1% stored in the atmosphere (Figure 1.2). On a
global scale, the ocean warming is largest near the surface, and
the upper 75 m warmed by 0.11 [0.09 to 0.13] °C per decade
over the period 1971 to 2010. It is virtually certain that the
upper ocean (0−700 m) warmed from 1971 to 2010, and it likely
warmed between the 1870s and 1971. It is likely that the ocean
warmed from 700 to 2000 m from 1957 to 2009 and from 3000 m
to the bottom for the period 1992 to 2005 (Figure 1.2). {WGI
SPM B.2, 3.2, Box 3.1}
It is very likely that regions of high surface salinity, where evaporation
dominates, have become more saline, while regions of low salinity, where
precipitation dominates, have become fresher since the 1950s. These
regional trends in ocean salinity provide indirect evidence for changes
in evaporation and precipitation over the oceans and thus for changes
in the global water cycle (medium confidence). There is no observational
evidence of a long-term trend in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning
Circulation (AMOC). {WGI SPM B.2, 2.5, 3.3, 3.4.3, 3.5, 3.6.3}
Since the beginning of the industrial era, oceanic uptake of CO2 has
resulted in acidification of the ocean; the pH of ocean surface water
has decreased by 0.1 (high confidence), corresponding to a 26%
increase in acidity, measured as hydrogen ion concentration. There
is medium confidence that, in parallel to warming, oxygen concen-
trations have decreased in coastal waters and in the open ocean
thermocline in many ocean regions since the 1960s, with a likely
expansion of tropical oxygen minimum zones in recent decades. {WGI
SPM B.5, TS2.8.5, 3.8.1, 3.8.2, 3.8.3, 3.8.5, Figure 3.20}

1.1.3 Cryosphere
Over the last two decades, the Greenland and Antarctic ice
sheets have been losing mass (high confidence). Glaciers have
continued to shrink almost worldwide (high confidence). North-
ern Hemisphere spring snow cover has continued to decrease
in extent (high confidence). There is high confidence that there
are strong regional differences in the trend in Antarctic sea ice
extent, with a very likely increase in total extent. {WGI SPM B.3,
4.2–4.7}
Glaciers have lost mass and contributed to sea level rise throughout
the 20th century. The rate of ice mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet
has very likely substantially increased over the period 1992 to 2011,
resulting in a larger mass loss over 2002 to 2011 than over 1992 to
2011. The rate of ice mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet, mainly
from the northern Antarctic Peninsula and the Amundsen Sea sector of
West Antarctica, is also likely larger over 2002 to 2011. {WGI SPM B.3,
SPM B.4, 4.3.3, 4.4.2, 4.4.3}
The annual mean Arctic sea ice extent decreased over the period 1979
(when satellite observations commenced) to 2012. The rate of decrease
was very likely in the range 3.5 to 4.1% per decade. Arctic sea ice extent
has decreased in every season and in every successive decade since
1979, with the most rapid decrease in decadal mean extent in summer
(high confidence). For the summer sea ice minimum, the decrease was
very likely in the range of 9.4 to 13.6% per decade (range of 0.73 to
1.07 million km2 per decade) (see Figure 1.1). It is very likely that the
annual mean Antarctic sea ice extent increased in the range of 1.2
to 1.8% per decade (range of 0.13 to 0.20 million km2 per decade)
between 1979 and 2012. However, there is high confidence that there
are strong regional differences in Antarctica, with extent increasing in
some regions and decreasing in others. {WGI SPM B.5, 4.2.2, 4.2.3}
There is very high confidence that the extent of Northern Hemisphere
snow cover has decreased since the mid-20th century by 1.6 [0.8 to
2.4] % per decade for March and April, and 11.7% per decade for June,
over the 1967 to 2012 period. There is high confidence that permafrost
temperatures have increased in most regions of the Northern Hemi-
sphere since the early 1980s, with reductions in thickness and areal
extent in some regions. The increase in permafrost temperatures has
occurred in response to increased surface temperature and changing
snow cover. {WGI SPM B.3, 4.5, 4.7.2}

1.1.4 Sea level
Over the period 1901–2010, global mean sea level rose by 0.19
[0.17 to 0.21] m (Figure 1.1). The rate of sea level rise since the
mid-19th century has been larger than the mean rate during the
previous two millennia (high confidence). {WGI SPM B.4, 3.7.2,
5.6.3, 13.2}
It is very likely that the mean rate of global averaged sea level rise was
1.7 [1.5 to 1.9] mm/yr between 1901 and 2010 and 3.2 [2.8 to 3.6]
mm/yr between 1993 and 2010. Tide gauge and satellite altimeter data
are consistent regarding the higher rate during the latter period. It is
likely that similarly high rates occurred between 1920 and 1950. {WGI
SPM B.4, 3.7, 13.2}
Since the early 1970s, glacier mass loss and ocean thermal expansion
from warming together explain about 75% of the observed global
mean sea level rise (high confidence). Over the period 1993–2010,
global mean sea level rise is, with high confidence, consistent with
the sum of the observed contributions from ocean thermal expansion,
due to warming, from changes in glaciers, the Greenland ice sheet,
the Antarctic ice sheet and land water storage. {WGI SPM B.4, 13.3.6}
Rates of sea level rise over broad regions can be several times larger
or smaller than the global mean sea level rise for periods of several
decades, due to fluctuations in ocean circulation. Since 1993, the
regional rates for the Western Pacific are up to three times larger than
the global mean, while those for much of the Eastern Pacific are near
zero or negative. {WGI 3.7.3, FAQ 13.1}
There is very high confidence that maximum global mean sea level
during the last interglacial period (129,000 to 116,000 years ago)
was, for several thousand years, at least 5 m higher than present and
high confidence that it did not exceed 10 m above present. During the
last interglacial period, the Greenland ice sheet very likely contributed
between 1.4 and 4.3 m to the higher global mean sea level, implying
with medium confidence an additional contribution from the Antarctic
ice sheet. This change in sea level occurred in the context of different
orbital forcing and with high-latitude surface temperature, averaged
over several thousand years, at least 2°C warmer than present (high
confidence). {WGI SPM B.4, 5.3.4, 5.6.2, 13.2.1}

1.2 Past and recent drivers of climate change
Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have
increased since the pre-industrial era driven largely
by economic and population growth. From 2000 to
2010 emissions were the highest in history. Historical
emissions have driven atmospheric concentrations of
carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide to levels
that are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000
years, leading to an uptake of energy by the climate
system.
Natural and anthropogenic substances and processes that alter the
Earth’s energy budget are physical drivers of climate change. Radiative
forcing quantifies the perturbation of energy into the Earth system
caused by these drivers. Radiative forcings larger than zero lead to a
near-surface warming, and radiative forcings smaller than zero lead to
a cooling. Radiative forcing is estimated based on in-situ and remote
observations, properties of GHGs and aerosols, and calculations using
numerical models. The radiative forcing over the 1750–2011 period is
shown in Figure 1.4 in major groupings. The ‘Other Anthropogenic’
group is principally comprised of cooling effects from aerosol changes,
with smaller contributions from ozone changes, land use reflectance
changes and other minor terms. {WGI SPM C, 8.1, 8.5.1}

1.2.1 Natural and anthropogenic radiative forcings
Atmospheric concentrations of GHGs are at levels that are
unprecedented in at least 800,000 years. Concentrations of
carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O)
have all shown large increases since 1750 (40%, 150% and 20%,
respectively) (Figure 1.3). CO2 concentrations are increasing at the
fastest observed decadal rate of change (2.0 ± 0.1 ppm/yr) for 2002–
2011. After almost one decade of stable CH4 concentrations since the
late 1990s, atmospheric measurements have shown renewed increases
since 2007. N2O concentrations have steadily increased at a rate of
0.73 ± 0.03 ppb/yr over the last three decades. {WGI SPM B5, 2.2.1,
6.1.2, 6.1.3, 6.3}
The total anthropogenic radiative forcing over 1750–2011
is calculated to be a warming effect of 2.3 [1.1 to 3.3] W/m2
(Figure 1.4), and it has increased more rapidly since 1970 than
during prior decades. Carbon dioxide is the largest single con-
tributor to radiative forcing over 1750–2011 and its trend since
1970. The total anthropogenic radiative forcing estimate for 2011
is substantially higher (43%) than the estimate reported in the IPCC
Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) for the year 2005. This is caused by
a combination of continued growth in most GHG concentrations and
an improved estimate of radiative forcing from aerosols. {WGI SPM C,
8.5.1}
The radiative forcing from aerosols, which includes cloud
adjustments, is better understood and indicates a weaker
cooling effect than in AR4. The aerosol radiative forcing over
1750–2011 is estimated as –0.9 [–1.9 to −0.1] W/m2 (medium
confidence). Radiative forcing from aerosols has two competing
components: a dominant cooling effect from most aerosols and
their cloud adjustments and a partially offsetting warming con-
tribution from black carbon absorption of solar radiation. There
is high confidence that the global mean total aerosol radiative forcing
has counteracted a substantial portion of radiative forcing from well-
mixed GHGs. Aerosols continue to contribute the largest uncertainty to
the total radiative forcing estimate. {WGI SPM C, 7.5, 8.3, 8.5.1}
Changes in solar irradiance and volcanic aerosols cause natu-
ral radiative forcing (Figure 1.4). The radiative forcing from strato-
spheric volcanic aerosols can have a large cooling effect on the climate
system for some years after major volcanic eruptions. Changes in total
solar irradiance are calculated to have contributed only around 2%
of the total radiative forcing in 2011, relative to 1750. {WGI SPM C,
Figure SPM.5, 8.4}

1.2.2 Human activities affecting emission drivers
About half of the cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions
between 1750 and 2011 have occurred in the last 40 years
(high confidence). Cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions of
2040 ± 310 GtCO2 were added to the atmosphere between 1750
and 2011. Since 1970, cumulative CO2 emissions from fossil fuel
combustion, cement production and flaring have tripled, and cumula-
tive CO2 emissions from forestry and other land use21(FOLU)22 have
increased by about 40% (Figure 1.5)23. In 2011, annual CO2 emis-
sions from fossil fuel combustion, cement production and flaring
were 34.8 ± 2.9 GtCO2/yr. For 2002–2011, average annual emissions
from FOLU were 3.3 ± 2.9 GtCO2/yr. {WGI 6.3.1, 6.3.2, WGIII SPM.3}
About 40% of these anthropogenic CO2 emissions have
remained in the atmosphere (880 ± 35 GtCO2) since 1750. The
rest was removed from the atmosphere by sinks, and stored in
natural carbon cycle reservoirs. Sinks from ocean uptake and vege-
tation with soils account, in roughly equal measures, for the remainder
of the cumulative CO2 emissions. The ocean has absorbed about 30%
of the emitted anthropogenic CO2, causing ocean acidification.
{WGI 3.8.1, 6.3.1}
Total annual anthropogenic GHG emissions have continued to
increase over 1970 to 2010 with larger absolute increases between
2000 and 2010 (high confidence). Despite a growing number of
climate change mitigation policies, annual GHG emissions grew on
average by 1.0 GtCO2-eq (2.2%) per year, from 2000 to 2010, com-
pared to 0.4 GtCO2-eq (1.3%) per year, from 1970 to 2000 (Figure 1.6)24.
Total anthropogenic GHG emissions from 2000 to 2010 were the
highest in human history and reached 49 (±4.5) GtCO2-eq/yr in 2010.
The global economic crisis of 2007/2008 reduced emissions only tem-
porarily. {WGIII SPM.3, 1.3, 5.2, 13.3, 15.2.2, Box TS.5, Figure 15.1}
CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial pro-
cesses contributed about 78% to the total GHG emission
increase between 1970 and 2010, with a contribution of sim-
ilar percentage over the 2000–2010 period (high confidence).
Fossil-fuel-related CO2 emissions reached 32 (±2.7) GtCO2/yr, in 2010,
and grew further by about 3% between 2010 and 2011, and by about
1 to 2% between 2011 and 2012. CO2 remains the major anthropo-
genic GHG, accounting for 76% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions
in 2010. Of the total, 16% comes from CH4, 6.2% from N2O, and 2.0%
from fluorinated gases (F-gases) (Figure 1.6)25. Annually, since 1970,
about 25% of anthropogenic GHG emissions have been in the form of
non-CO2 gases26. {WGIII SPM.3, 1.2, 5.2}
Total annual anthropogenic GHG emissions have increased by
about 10 GtCO2-eq between 2000 and 2010. This increase directly
came from the energy (47%), industry (30%), transport (11%)
and building (3%) sectors (medium confidence). Accounting for
indirect emissions raises the contributions by the building and
industry sectors (high confidence). Since 2000, GHG emissions have
been growing in all sectors, except in agriculture, forestry and other
land use (AFOLU)22. In 2010, 35% of GHG emissions were released by
the energy sector, 24% (net emissions) from AFOLU, 21% by industry,
14% by transport and 6.4% by the building sector. When emissions
from electricity and heat production are attributed to the sectors that
use the final energy (i.e., indirect emissions), the shares of the industry
and building sectors in global GHG emissions are increased to 31%
and 19%, respectively (Figure 1.7). {WGIII SPM.3, 7.3, 8.1, 9.2, 10.3,
11.2} See also Box 3.2 for contributions from various sectors, based on
metrics other than 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP100).
Globally, economic and population growth continue to be the
most important drivers of increases in CO2 emissions from
fossil fuel combustion. The contribution of population growth
between 2000 and 2010 remained roughly identical to that of
the previous three decades, while the contribution of economic
growth has risen sharply (high confidence). Between 2000 and
2010, both drivers outpaced emission reductions from improvements
in energy intensity of gross domestic product (GDP) (Figure 1.8).
Increased use of coal relative to other energy sources has reversed
the long-standing trend in gradual decarbonization (i.e., reducing the
carbon intensity of energy) of the world’s energy supply. {WGIII SPM.3,
TS.2.2, 1.3, 5.3, 7.2, 7.3, 14.3}

1.3 Attribution of climate
changes and impacts
The evidence for human influence on the climate
system has grown since AR4. Human influence has
been detected in warming of the atmosphere and the
ocean, in changes in the global water cycle, in reduc-
tions in snow and ice, and in global mean sea level
rise; and it is extremely likely to have been the domi-
nant cause of the observed warming since the mid-
20th century. In recent decades, changes in climate
have caused impacts on natural and human systems
on all continents and across the oceans. Impacts are
due to observed climate change, irrespective of its
cause, indicating the sensitivity of natural and human
systems to changing climate.
The causes of observed changes in the climate system, as well as in any
natural or human system impacted by climate, are established follow-
ing a consistent set of methods. Detection addresses the question of
whether climate or a natural or human system affected by climate has
actually changed in a statistical sense, while attribution evaluates the
relative contributions of multiple causal factors to an observed change
or event with an assignment of statistical confidence27. Attribution of
climate change to causes quantifies the links between observed climate
change and human activity, as well as other, natural, climate drivers. In
contrast, attribution of observed impacts to climate change considers
the links between observed changes in natural or human systems and
observed climate change, regardless of its cause. Results from studies
attributing climate change to causes provide estimates of the magni-
tude of warming in response to changes in radiative forcing and hence
support projections of future climate change (Topic 2). Results from
studies attributing impacts to climate change provide strong indica-
tions for the sensitivity of natural or human systems to future climate
change. {WGI 10.8, WGII SPM A-1, WGI/II/III/SYR Glossaries}

1.3.1 Attribution of climate changes to human and
natural influences on the climate system
It is extremely likely that more than half of the observed
increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to
2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in GHG concen-
trations and other anthropogenic forcings together (Figure 1.9).
The best estimate of the human induced contribution to warming is
similar to the observed warming over this period. GHGs contributed a
global mean surface warming likely to be in the range of 0.5°C to 1.3°C
over the period 1951 to 2010, with further contributions from other
anthropogenic forcings, including the cooling effect of aerosols, from
natural forcings, and from natural internal variability (see Figure 1.9).
Together these assessed contributions are consistent with the observed
warming of approximately 0.6°C to 0.7°C over this period. {WGI SPM D.3,
10.3.1}
It is very likely that anthropogenic influence, particularly GHGs and
stratospheric ozone depletion, has led to a detectable observed pat-
tern of tropospheric warming and a corresponding cooling in the lower
stratosphere since 1961. {WGI SPM D.3, 2.4.4, 9.4.1, 10.3.1}
Over every continental region except Antarctica, anthropogenic
forcings have likely made a substantial contribution to surface
temperature increases since the mid-20th century (Figure 1.10).
For Antarctica, large observational uncertainties result in low confi-
dence that anthropogenic forcings have contributed to the observed
warming averaged over available stations. In contrast, it is likely that
there has been an anthropogenic contribution to the very substantial
Arctic warming since the mid-20th century. Human influence has likely
contributed to temperature increases in many sub-continental regions.
{WGI SPM D.3, TS.4.8, 10.3.1}
Anthropogenic influences have very likely contributed to Arctic
sea ice loss since 1979 (Figure 1.10). There is low confidence in the
scientific understanding of the small observed increase in Antarctic sea
ice extent due to the incomplete and competing scientific explanations
for the causes of change and low confidence in estimates of natural
internal variability in that region. {WGI SPM D.3, 10.5.1, Figure 10.16}
Anthropogenic influences likely contributed to the retreat of glaciers
since the 1960s and to the increased surface melting of the Green-
land ice sheet since 1993. Due to a low level of scientific understand-
ing, however, there is low confidence in attributing the causes of the
observed loss of mass from the Antarctic ice sheet over the past two
decades. It is likely that there has been an anthropogenic contribu-
tion to observed reductions in Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover
since 1970. {WGI 4.3.3, 10.5.2, 10.5.3}
It is likely that anthropogenic influences have affected the
global water cycle since 1960. Anthropogenic influences have
contributed to observed increases in atmospheric moisture content
(medium confidence), to global-scale changes in precipitation patterns
over land (medium confidence), to intensification of heavy precipita-
tion over land regions where data are sufficient (medium confidence)
(see 1.4) and to changes in surface and subsurface ocean salinity (very
likely). {WGI SPM D.3, 2.5.1, 2.6.2, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 7.6.2, 10.3.2, 10.4.2,
10.6}
It is very likely that anthropogenic forcings have made a sub-
stantial contribution to increases in global upper ocean heat
content (0–700 m) observed since the 1970s (Figure 1.10). There
is evidence for human influence in some individual ocean basins. It is
very likely that there is a substantial anthropogenic contribution to the
global mean sea level rise since the 1970s. This is based on the high
confidence in an anthropogenic influence on the two largest contribu-
tions to sea level rise: thermal expansion and glacier mass loss. Oceanic
uptake of anthropogenic CO2 has resulted in gradual acidification of
ocean surface waters (high confidence). {WGI SPM D.3, 3.2.3, 3.8.2,
10.4.1, 10.4.3, 10.4.4, 10.5.2, 13.3, Box 3.2, TS.4.4, WGII 6.1.1.2,
Box CC-OA}

1.3.2 Observed impacts attributed to climate change
In recent decades, changes in climate have caused impacts on
natural and human systems on all continents and across the
oceans. Impacts are due to observed climate change, irrespective
of its cause, indicating the sensitivity of natural and human
systems to changing climate. Evidence of observed climate change
impacts is strongest and most comprehensive for natural systems.
Some impacts on human systems have also been attributed to climate
change, with a major or minor contribution of climate change distin-
guishable from other influences (Figure 1.11). Impacts on human sys-
tems are often geographically heterogeneous because they depend not
only on changes in climate variables but also on social and economic
factors. Hence, the changes are more easily observed at local levels,
while attribution can remain difficult. {WGII SPM A-1, SPM A-3, 18.1,
18.3–18.6}
In many regions, changing precipitation or melting snow and
ice are altering hydrological systems, affecting water resources
in terms of quantity and quality (medium confidence). Glaciers
continue to shrink almost worldwide due to climate change (high con-
fidence), affecting runoff and water resources downstream (medium
confidence). Climate change is causing permafrost warming and thaw-
ing in high-latitude regions and in high-elevation regions (high confi-
dence). {WGII SPM A-1}
Many terrestrial, freshwater and marine species have shifted
their geographic ranges, seasonal activities, migration patterns,
abundances and species interactions in response to ongoing cli-
mate change (high confidence). While only a few recent species
extinctions have been attributed as yet to climate change (high con-
fidence), natural global climate change at rates slower than current
anthropogenic climate change caused significant ecosystem shifts and
species extinctions during the past millions of years (high confidence).
Increased tree mortality, observed in many places worldwide, has been
attributed to climate change in some regions. Increases in the fre-
quency or intensity of ecosystem disturbances such as droughts, wind-
storms, fires and pest outbreaks have been detected in many parts of
the world and in some cases are attributed to climate change (medium
confidence). Numerous observations over the last decades in all ocean
basins show changes in abundance, distribution shifts poleward and/
or to deeper, cooler waters for marine fishes, invertebrates and phyto-
plankton (very high confidence), and altered ecosystem composition
(high confidence), tracking climate trends. Some warm-water corals
and their reefs have responded to warming with species replacement,
bleaching, and decreased coral cover causing habitat loss (high confi-
dence). Some impacts of ocean acidification on marine organisms have
been attributed to human influence, from the thinning of pteropod and
foraminiferan shells (medium confidence) to the declining growth rates
of corals (low confidence). Oxygen minimum zones are progressively
expanding in the tropical Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans, due to
reduced ventilation and O2 solubility in warmer, more stratified oceans,
and are constraining fish habitat (medium confidence). {WGII SPM A-1,
Table SPM.A1, TS A-1, 6.3.2.5, 6.3.3, 18.3–18.4, 30.5.1.1, Box CC-OA,
Box CC-CR}
Assessment of many studies covering a wide range of regions
and crops shows that negative impacts of climate change on
crop yields have been more common than positive impacts
(high confidence). The smaller number of studies showing positive
impacts relate mainly to high-latitude regions, though it is not yet
clear whether the balance of impacts has been negative or positive
in these regions (high confidence). Climate change has negatively
affected wheat and maize yields for many regions and in the global
aggregate (medium confidence). Effects on rice and soybean yield
have been smaller in major production regions and globally, with
a median change of zero across all available data which are fewer
for soy compared to the other crops (see Figure 1.11c). Observed
impacts relate mainly to production aspects of food security rather
than access or other components of food security. Since AR4, several
periods of rapid food and cereal price increases following climate
extremes in key producing regions indicate a sensitivity of current
markets to climate extremes among other factors (medium con-
fidence). {WGII SPM A-1}
At present the worldwide burden of human ill-health from cli-
mate change is relatively small compared with effects of other
stressors and is not well quantified. However, there has been
increased heat-related mortality and decreased cold-related mortality
in some regions as a result of warming (medium confidence). Local
changes in temperature and rainfall have altered the distribution of
some water-borne illnesses and disease vectors (medium confidence).
{WGII SPM A-1}
‘Cascading’ impacts of climate change can now be attributed
along chains of evidence from physical climate through to inter-
mediate systems and then to people (Figure 1.12). The changes
in climate feeding into the cascade, in some cases, are linked to human
drivers (e.g., a decreasing amount of water in spring snowpack in west-
ern North America), while, in other cases, assessments of the causes of
observed climate change leading into the cascade are not available. In
all cases, confidence in detection and attribution to observed climate
change decreases for effects further down each impact chain. {WGII
18.6.3}

1.4 Extreme events
Changes in many extreme weather and climate events
have been observed since about 1950. Some of these
changes have been linked to human influences, includ-
ing a decrease in cold temperature extremes, an
increase in warm temperature extremes, an increase in
extreme high sea levels and an increase in the number
of heavy precipitation events in a number of regions.
It is very likely that the number of cold days and nights has
decreased and the number of warm days and nights has
increased on the global scale. It is likely that the frequency of heat
waves has increased in large parts of Europe, Asia and Australia. It is
very likely that human influence has contributed to the observed global
scale changes in the frequency and intensity of daily temperature
extremes since the mid-20th century. It is likely that human influence
has more than doubled the probability of occurrence of heat waves in
some locations. {WGI SPM B.1, SPM D.3, Table SPM.1, FAQ 2.2, 2.6.1,
10.6}
There is medium confidence that the observed warming has
increased heat-related human mortality and decreased cold-
related human mortality in some regions. Extreme heat events cur-
rently result in increases in mortality and morbidity in North America
(very high confidence), and in Europe with impacts that vary according
to people’s age, location and socio-economic factors (high confidence).
{WGII SPM A-1, 11.4.1, Table 23-1, 26.6.1.2}
There are likely more land regions where the number of heavy
precipitation events has increased than where it has decreased.
The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events has likely
increased in North America and Europe. In other continents, confidence
in trends is at most medium. It is very likely that global near-surface
and tropospheric air specific humidity has increased since the 1970s.
In land regions where observational coverage is sufficient for assess-
ment, there is medium confidence that anthropogenic forcing has con-
tributed to a global-scale intensification of heavy precipitation over
the second half of the 20th century. {WGI SPM B-1, 2.5.1, 2.5.4–2.5.5,
2.6.2, 10.6, Table SPM.1, FAQ 2.2, SREX Table 3-1, 3.2}
There is low confidence that anthropogenic climate change has
affected the frequency and magnitude of fluvial floods on a
global scale. The strength of the evidence is limited mainly by a lack of
long-term records from unmanaged catchments. Moreover, floods are
strongly influenced by many human activities impacting catchments,
making the attribution of detected changes to climate change difficult.
However, recent detection of increasing trends in extreme precipitation
and discharges in some catchments implies greater risks of flooding on
a regional scale (medium confidence). Costs related to flood damage,
worldwide, have been increasing since the 1970s, although this is
partly due to the increasing exposure of people and assets. {WGI 2.6.2,
WGII 3.2.7, SREX SPM B}
There is low confidence in observed global-scale trends in
droughts, due to lack of direct observations, dependencies of
inferred trends on the choice of the definition for drought, and
due to geographical inconsistencies in drought trends. There
is also low confidence in the attribution of changes in drought over
global land areas since the mid-20th century, due to the same observa-
tional uncertainties and difficulties in distinguishing decadal scale var-
iability in drought from long-term trends. {WGI Table SPM.1, 2.6.2.3,
10.6, Figure 2.33, WGII 3.ES, 3.2.7}
There is low confidence that long-term changes in tropical
cyclone activity are robust, and there is low confidence in the
attribution of global changes to any particular cause. However, it
is virtually certain that intense tropical cyclone activity has increased in
the North Atlantic since 1970. {WGI Table SPM.1, 2.6.3, 10.6}
It is likely that extreme sea levels (for example, as experienced
in storm surges) have increased since 1970, being mainly the
result of mean sea level rise. Due to a shortage of studies and the
difficulty of distinguishing any such impacts from other modifications
to coastal systems, limited evidence is available on the impacts of sea
level rise. {WGI 3.7.4–3.7.6, Figure 3.15, WGII 5.3.3.2, 18.3}
Impacts from recent climate-related extremes, such as heat
waves, droughts, floods, cyclones and wildfires, reveal signifi-
cant vulnerability and exposure of some ecosystems and many
human systems to current climate variability (very high confi-
dence). Impacts of such climate-related extremes include alteration of
ecosystems, disruption of food production and water supply, damage
to infrastructure and settlements, human morbidity and mortality and
consequences for mental health and human well-being. For countries
at all levels of development, these impacts are consistent with a sig-
nificant lack of preparedness for current climate variability in some
sectors. {WGII SPM A-1, 3.2, 4.2-3, 8.1, 9.3, 10.7, 11.3, 11.7, 13.2, 14.1,
18.6, 22.2.3, 22.3, 23.3.1.2, 24.4.1, 25.6-8, 26.6-7, 30.5,Table 18-3,
Table 23-1, Figure 26-2, Box 4-3, Box 4-4, Box 25-5, Box 25-6,
Box 25-8, Box CC-CR}
Direct and insured losses from weather-related disasters have
increased substantially in recent decades, both globally and
regionally. Increasing exposure of people and economic assets has
been the major cause of long-term increases in economic losses from
weather- and climate-related disasters (high confidence). {WGII 10.7.3,
SREX SPM B, 4.5.3.3}

1.5 Exposure and vulnerability
The character and severity of impacts from climate
change and extreme events emerge from risk that
depends not only on climate-related hazards but also
on exposure (people and assets at risk) and vulner-
ability (susceptibility to harm) of human and natural
systems.
Exposure and vulnerability are influenced by a wide range of
social, economic and cultural factors and processes that have
been incompletely considered to date and that make quanti-
tative assessments of their future trends difficult (high confi-
dence). These factors include wealth and its distribution across soci-
ety, demographics, migration, access to technology and information,
employment patterns, the quality of adaptive responses, societal
values, governance structures and institutions to resolve conflict. {WGII
SPM A-3, SREX SPM B}
Differences in vulnerability and exposure arise from non-climatic
factors and from multidimensional inequalities often produced
by uneven development processes (very high confidence). These
differences shape differential risks from climate change. People
who are socially, economically, culturally, politically, institutionally or
otherwise marginalized are especially vulnerable to climate change
and also to some adaptation and mitigation responses (medium
evidence, high agreement). This heightened vulnerability is rarely
due to a single cause. Rather, it is the product of intersecting social
processes that result in inequalities in socio-economic status and
income, as well as in exposure. Such social processes include, for
example, discrimination on the basis of gender, class, ethnicity, age
and (dis)ability. {WGII SPM A-1, Figure SPM.1, 8.1–8.2, 9.3–9.4, 10.9,
11.1, 11.3–11.5, 12.2–12.5, 13.1–13.3, 14.1–14.3, 18.4, 19.6, 23.5,
25.8, 26.6, 26.8, 28.4, Box CC-GC}
Climate-related hazards exacerbate other stressors, often with
negative outcomes for livelihoods, especially for people living
in poverty (high confidence). Climate-related hazards affect poor
people’s lives directly through impacts on livelihoods, reductions in
crop yields or the destruction of homes, and indirectly through, for
example, increased food prices and food insecurity. Observed positive
effects for poor and marginalized people, which are limited and often
indirect, include examples such as diversification of social networks
and of agricultural practices. {WGII SPM A-1, 8.2–8.3, 9.3, 11.3, 13.1–
13.3, 22.3, 24.4, 26.8}
Violent conflict increases vulnerability to climate change
(medium evidence, high agreement). Large-scale violent conflict
harms assets that facilitate adaptation, including infrastructure, insti-
tutions, natural resources, social capital and livelihood opportunities.
{WGII SPM A-1, 12.5, 19.2, 19.6}

1.6 Human responses to climate change:
adaptation and mitigation
Adaptation and mitigation experience is accumulating
across regions and scales, even while global
anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have
continued to increase.
Throughout history, people and societies have adjusted to and coped
with climate, climate variability and extremes, with varying degrees
of success. In today’s changing climate, accumulating experience with
adaptation and mitigation efforts can provide opportunities for learn-
ing and refinement (3, 4). {WGII SPM A-2}
Adaptation is becoming embedded in some planning pro-
cesses, with more limited implementation of responses (high
confidence). Engineered and technological options are commonly
implemented adaptive responses, often integrated within existing pro-
grammes, such as disaster risk management and water management.
There is increasing recognition of the value of social, institutional and
ecosystem-based measures and of the extent of constraints to adap-
tation. {WGII SPM A-2, 4.4, 5.5, 6.4, 8.3, 9.4, 11.7, 14.1, 14.3–14.4,
15.2–15.5, 17.2–17.3, 21.3, 21.5, 22.4, 23.7, 25.4, 26.8–26.9, 30.6,
Box 25-1, Box 25-2, Box 25-9, Box CC-EA}
Governments at various levels have begun to develop adapta-
tion plans and policies and integrate climate change consider-
ations into broader development plans. Examples of adaptation
are now available from all regions of the world (see Topic 4 for details
on adaptation options and policies to support their implementation).
{WGII SPM A-2, 22.4, 23.7, 24.4–24.6, 24.9, 25.4, 25.10, 26.7–26.9,
27.3, 28.2, 28.4, 29.3, 29.6, 30.6, Table 25-2, Table 29-3, Figure 29-1,
Box 5-1, Box 23-3, Box 25-1, Box 25-2, Box 25-9, Box CC-TC}
Global increases in anthropogenic emissions and climate
impacts have occurred, even while mitigation activities have
taken place in many parts of the world. Though various mitiga-
tion initiatives between the sub-national and global scales have been
developed or implemented, a full assessment of their impact may be
premature. {WGIII SPM.3, SPM.5}

2.1 Key drivers of future climate and the
basis on which projections are made
Cumulative emissions of CO 2 largely determine global
mean surface warming by the late 21st century and
beyond. Projections of greenhouse gas emissions vary
over a wide range, depending on both socio-economic
development and climate policy.
Climate models are mathematical representations of processes impor-
tant in the Earth’s climate system. Results from a hierarchy of climate
models are considered in this report; ranging from simple idealized
models, to models of intermediate complexity, to comprehensive Gen-
eral Circulation Models (GCMs), including Earth System Models (ESMs)
that also simulate the carbon cycle. The GCMs simulate many climate
aspects, including the temperature of the atmosphere and the oceans,
precipitation, winds, clouds, ocean currents and sea-ice extent. The
models are extensively tested against historical observations (Box 2.1).
{WGI 1.5.2, 9.1.2, 9.2, 9.8.1}
In order to obtain climate change projections, the climate models use
information described in scenarios of GHG and air pollutant emis-
sions and land use patterns. Scenarios are generated by a range of
approaches, from simple idealised experiments to Integrated Assess-
ment Models (IAMs, see Glossary). Key factors driving changes in
anthropogenic GHG emissions are economic and population growth,
lifestyle and behavioural changes, associated changes in energy use
and land use, technology and climate policy, which are fundamentally
uncertain. {WGI 11.3, 12.4, WGIII 5, 6, 6.1}
The standard set of scenarios used in the AR5 is called Representative
Concentration Pathways (RCPs, Box 2.2). {WGI Box SPM.1}
The methods used to estimate future impacts and risks resulting from
climate change are described in Box 2.3. Modelled future impacts
assessed in this report are generally based on climate-model projec-
tions using the RCPs, and in some cases, the older Special Report on
Emissions Scenarios (SRES). {WGI Box SPM.1, WGII 1.1, 1.3, 2.2–2.3,
19.6, 20.2, 21.3, 21.5, 26.2, Box CC-RC}
Risk of climate-related impacts results from the interaction
between climate-related hazards (including hazardous events
and trends) and the vulnerability and exposure of human and
natural systems. Alternative development paths influence risk by
changing the likelihood of climatic events and trends, through their
effects on GHGs, pollutants and land use, and by altering vulnerability
and exposure. {WGII SPM, 19.2.4, Figure 19-1, Box 19-2}
Experiments, observations and models used to estimate future
impacts and risks have improved since the AR4, with increas-
ing understanding across sectors and regions. For example, an
improved knowledge base has enabled expanded assessment of
risks for human security and livelihoods and for the oceans. For some
aspects of climate change and climate change impacts, uncertainty
about future outcomes has narrowed. For others, uncertainty will per-
sist. Some of the persistent uncertainties are grounded in the mecha-
nisms that control the magnitude and pace of climate change. Others
emerge from potentially complex interactions between the changing
climate and the underlying vulnerability and exposure of people, soci-
eties and ecosystems. The combination of persistent uncertainty in
key mechanisms plus the prospect of complex interactions motivates
a focus on risk in this report. Because risk involves both probability
and consequence, it is important to consider the full range of possible
outcomes, including low-probability, high-consequence impacts that
are difficult to simulate. {WGII 2.1–2.4, 3.6, 4.3, 11.3, 12.6, 19.2, 19.6,
21.3–21.5, 22.4, 25.3–25.4, 25.11, 26.2}

2.2.1 Air temperature2021
The global mean surface temperature change for the period 2016–
2035 relative to 1986–2005 is similar for the four RCPs, and will
likely be in the range 0.3°C to 0.7°C (medium confidence)3022
. This
range assumes no major volcanic eruptions or changes in some natural
sources (e.g., methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O)), or unexpected
changes in total solar irradiance. Future climate will depend on
committed warming caused by past anthropogenic emissions, as well
as future anthropogenic emissions and natural climate variability.
By the mid-21st century, the magnitude of the projected climate
change is substantially affected by the choice of emissions scenarios.
Climate change continues to diverge among the scenarios through
to 2100 and beyond (Table 2.1, Figure 2.1). The ranges provided for
particular RCPs (Table 2.1), and those given below in Section 2.2,
primarily arise from differences in the sensitivity of climate models to
the imposed forcing. {WGI SPM E.1, 11.3.2, 12.4.1}
Relative to 1850–1900, global surface temperature change for
the end of the 21st century (2081–2100) is projected to likely
exceed 1.5°C for RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (high confidence).
Warming is likely to exceed 2°C for RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (high
confidence), more likely than not to exceed 2°C for RCP4.5
(medium confidence), but unlikely to exceed 2°C for RCP2.6
(medium confidence). {WGI SPM E.1, 12.4.1, Table 12.3}
The Arctic region will continue to warm more rapidly than the global
mean (Figure 2.2) (very high confidence). The mean warming over
land will be larger than over the ocean (very high confidence) and
larger than global average warming (Figure 2.2). {WGI SPM E.1, 11.3.2,
12.4.3, 14.8.2}
It is virtually certain that there will be more frequent hot and
fewer cold temperature extremes over most land areas on daily
and seasonal timescales, as global mean surface temperature
increases. It is very likely that heat waves will occur with a higher
frequency and longer duration. Occasional cold winter extremes will
continue to occur. {WGI SPM E.1, 12.4.3}

2.2.2 Water cycle
Changes in precipitation in a warming world will not be uniform.
The high latitudes and the equatorial Pacific are likely to experience an
increase in annual mean precipitation by the end of this century under
the RCP8.5 scenario. In many mid-latitude and subtropical dry regions,
mean precipitation will likely decrease, while in many mid-latitude wet
regions, mean precipitation will likely increase under the RCP8.5 sce-
nario (Figure 2.2). {WGI SPM E.2, 7.6.2, 12.4.5, 14.3.1, 14.3.5}
Extreme precipitation events over most mid-latitude land masses and
over wet tropical regions will very likely become more intense and
more frequent as global mean surface temperature increases. {WGI
SPM E.2, 7.6.2, 12.4.5}
Globally, in all RCPs, it is likely that the area encompassed by monsoon
systems will increase and monsoon precipitation is likely to intensify
and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) related precipitation varia-
bility on regional scales will likely intensify. {WGI SPM E.2, 14.2, 14.4}

2.2.3 Ocean, cryosphere and sea level
The global ocean will continue to warm during the 21st century.
The strongest ocean warming is projected for the surface in tropical
and Northern Hemisphere subtropical regions. At greater depth the
warming will be most pronounced in the Southern Ocean (high confi-
dence). {WGI SPM E.4, 6.4.5, 12.4.7}
It is very likely that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Cir-
culation (AMOC) will weaken over the 21st century, with best
estimates and model ranges for the reduction of 11% (1 to 24%) for
the RCP2.6 scenario, 34% (12 to 54%) for the RCP8.5. Nevertheless,
it is very unlikely that the AMOC will undergo an abrupt transition or
collapse in the 21st century. {WGI SPM E.4, 12.4.7.2}
Year-round reductions in Arctic sea ice are projected for all RCP
scenarios. The subset of models that most closely reproduce the obser-
vations3123project that a nearly ice-free Arctic Ocean3224in September is
likely for RCP8.5 before mid-century (medium confidence) (Figure 2.1).
In the Antarctic, a decrease in sea ice extent and volume is projected
with low confidence. {WGI SPM E.5, 12.4.6.1}
The area of Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover is likely to
decrease by 7% for RCP2.6 and by 25% in RCP8.5 by the end of the
21st century for the multi-model average (medium confidence). {WGI
SPM E.5, 12.4.6}
It is virtually certain that near-surface permafrost extent at high
northern latitudes will be reduced as global mean surface tem-
perature increases. The area of permafrost near the surface (upper
3.5 m) is likely to decrease by 37% (RCP2.6) to 81% (RCP8.5) for the
multi-model average (medium confidence). {WGI SPM E.5, 12.4.6}
The global glacier volume, excluding glaciers on the periphery of Ant-
arctica (and excluding the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets), is pro-
jected to decrease by 15 to 55% for RCP2.6 and by 35 to 85% for
RCP8.5 (medium confidence). {WGI SPM E.5, 13.4.2, 13.5.1}
Global mean sea level will continue to rise during the 21st cen-
tury (Table 2.1, Figure 2.1). There has been significant improvement
in understanding and projection of sea level change since the AR4.
Under all RCP scenarios, the rate of sea level rise will very likely exceed
the observed rate of 2.0 [1.7–2.3] mm/yr during 1971–2010, with the
rate of rise for RCP8.5 during 2081–2100 of 8 to 16 mm/yr (medium
confidence). {WGI SPM B4, SPM E.6, 13.5.1}
Sea level rise will not be uniform across regions. By the end of
the 21st century, it is very likely that sea level will rise in more than
about 95% of the ocean area. Sea level rise depends on the pathway
of CO2 emissions, not only on the cumulative total; reducing emissions
earlier rather than later, for the same cumulative total, leads to a larger
mitigation of sea level rise. About 70% of the coastlines worldwide
are projected to experience sea level change within ±20% of the
global mean (Figure 2.2). It is very likely that there will be a significant
increase in the occurrence of future sea level extremes in some regions
by 2100. {WGI SPM E.6, TS 5.7.1, 12.4.1, 13.4.1, 13.5.1, 13.6.5, 13.7.2,
Table 13.5}

2.2.4 Carbon cycle and biogeochemistry
Ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 will continue under all four
RCPs through to 2100, with higher uptake for higher concen-
tration pathways (very high confidence). The future evolution of
the land carbon uptake is less certain. A majority of models projects a
continued land carbon uptake under all RCPs, but some models simulate
a land carbon loss due to the combined effect of climate change and
land use change. {WGI SPM E.7, 6.4.2, 6.4.3}
Based on Earth System Models, there is high confidence that
the feedback between climate change and the carbon cycle will
amplify global warming. Climate change will partially offset increases
in land and ocean carbon sinks caused by rising atmospheric CO2. As a
result more of the emitted anthropogenic CO2 will remain in the atmos-
phere, reinforcing the warming. {WGI SPM E.7, 6.4.2, 6.4.3}
Earth System Models project a global increase in ocean acidifi-
cation for all RCP scenarios by the end of the 21st century, with
a slow recovery after mid-century under RCP2.6. The decrease in
surface ocean pH is in the range of 0.06 to 0.07 (15 to 17% increase in
acidity) for RCP2.6, 0.14 to 0.15 (38 to 41%) for RCP4.5, 0.20 to 0.21
(58 to 62%) for RCP6.0, and 0.30 to 0.32 (100 to 109%) for RCP8.5
(Figure 2.1). {WGI SPM E.7, 6.4.4}
It is very likely that the dissolved oxygen content of the ocean
will decrease by a few percent during the 21st century in
response to surface warming, predominantly in the subsurface
mid-latitude oceans. There is no consensus on the future volume of
low oxygen waters in the open ocean because of large uncertainties in
potential biogeochemical effects and in the evolution of tropical ocean
dynamics. {WGI TS 5.6, 6.4.5, WGII TS B-2, 6.1}

2.2.5 Climate system responses
Climate system properties that determine the response to external
forcing have been estimated both from climate models and from anal-
ysis of past and recent climate change. The equilibrium climate sensi-
tivity (ECS)3325is likely in the range 1.5°C to 4.5°C, extremely unlikely
less than 1°C, and very unlikely greater than 6°C. {WGI SPM D.2, TS
TFE.6, 10.8.1, 10.8.2, 12.5.4, Box 12.2}
Cumulative emissions of CO2 largely determine global mean sur-
face warming by the late 21st century and beyond. Multiple lines of
evidence indicate a strong and consistent near-linear relationship across
all scenarios considered between net cumulative CO2 emissions (includ-
ing the impact of CO2 removal) and projected global temperature change
to the year 2100 (Figure 2.3). Past emissions and observed warming sup-
port this relationship within uncertainties. Any given level of warming
is associated with a range of cumulative CO2 emissions (depending on
non-CO2 drivers), and therefore, for example, higher emissions in earlier
decades imply lower emissions later. {WGI SPM E.8, TS TFE.8, 12.5.4}
The global mean peak surface temperature change per trillion
tonnes of carbon (1000 GtC) emitted as CO2 is likely in the range
of 0.8°C to 2.5°C. This quantity, called the transient climate response
to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE), is supported by both modelling
and observational evidence and applies to cumulative emissions up to
about 2000 GtC. {WGI SPM D.2, TS TFE.6, 12.5.4, Box 12.2}
Warming caused by CO2 emissions is effectively irreversible
over multi-century timescales unless measures are taken to
remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Ensuring CO2-induced warming
remains likely less than 2°C requires cumulative CO2 emissions from all
anthropogenic sources to remain below about 3650 GtCO2 (1000 GtC),
over half of which were already emitted by 2011. {WGI SPM E.8,
TS TFE.8, 12.5.2, 12.5.3, 12.5.4}
Multi-model results show that limiting total human-induced warming
(accounting for both CO2 and other human influences on climate) to less
than 2°C relative to the period 1861–1880 with a probability of >66%
would require total CO2 emissions from all anthropogenic sources
since 1870 to be limited to about 2900 GtCO2 when accounting for
non-CO2 forcing as in the RCP2.6 scenario, with a range of 2550 to
3150 GtCO2 arising from variations in non-CO2 climate drivers across
the scenarios considered by WGIII (Table 2.2). About 1900 [1650 to
2150] GtCO2 were emitted by 2011, leaving about 1000 GtCO2 to be
consistent with this temperature goal. Estimated total fossil carbon
reserves exceed this remaining amount by a factor of 4 to 7, with
resources much larger still. {WGI SPM E.8, TS TFE.8, Figure 1, TS.SM.10,
12.5.4, Figure 12.45, WGIII Table SPM.1, Table 6.3, Table 7.2}

2.3 Future risks and impacts caused
by a changing climate
Climate change will amplify existing risks and create
new risks for natural and human systems. Risks are
unevenly distributed and are generally greater for
disadvantaged people and communities in countries
at all levels of development. Increasing magnitudes of
warming increase the likelihood of severe, pervasive
and irreversible impacts for people, species and
ecosystems. Continued high emissions would lead to
mostly negative impacts for biodiversity, ecosystem
services and economic development and amplify risks
for livelihoods and for food and human security.
Risk of climate-related impacts results from the interaction of cli-
mate-related hazards (including hazardous events and trends) with the
vulnerability and exposure of human and natural systems, including
their ability to adapt. Rising rates and magnitudes of warming and
other changes in the climate system, accompanied by ocean acidifica-
tion, increase the risk of severe, pervasive, and in some cases, irrevers-
ible detrimental impacts. Future climate change will amplify existing
climate-related risks and create new risks. {WGII SPM B, Figure SPM.1}
Key risks are potentially severe impacts relevant to understanding dan-
gerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Risks are
considered key due to high hazard or high vulnerability of societies and
systems exposed, or both. Their identification is based on large magni-
tude or high probability of impacts; irreversibility or timing of impacts;
persistent vulnerability or exposure; or limited potential to reduce risks.
Some risks are particularly relevant for individual regions (Figure 2.4),
while others are global (Table 2.3). For risk assessment it is important to
evaluate the widest possible range of impacts, including low-probability
outcomes with large consequences. Risk levels often increase with
temperature (Box 2.4) and are sometimes more directly linked to other
dimensions of climate change, such as the rate of warming, as well
as the magnitudes and rates of ocean acidification and sea level rise
(Figure 2.5). {WGII SPM A-3, SPM B-1}
Key risks that span sectors and regions include the following
(high confidence) {WGII SPM B-1}:
1. Risk of severe ill-health and disrupted livelihoods resulting from
storm surges, sea level rise and coastal flooding; inland flooding in
some urban regions; and periods of extreme heat.
2. Systemic risks due to extreme weather events leading to break-
down of infrastructure networks and critical services.
3. Risk of food and water insecurity and loss of rural livelihoods and
income, particularly for poorer populations.
4. Risk of loss of ecosystems, biodiversity and ecosystem goods, func-
tions and services.
The overall risks of future climate change impacts can be
reduced by limiting the rate and magnitude of climate change,
including ocean acidification. Some risks are considerable even at
1°C global mean temperature increase above pre-industrial levels.
Many global risks are high to very high for global temperature increases
of 4°C or more (see Box 2.4). These risks include severe and wide-
spread impacts on unique and threatened systems, the extinction of
many species, large risks to food security and compromised normal
human activities, including growing food or working outdoors in some
areas for parts of the year, due to the combination of high temperature
and humidity (high confidence). The precise levels of climate change
sufficient to trigger abrupt and irreversible change remain uncertain,
but the risk associated with crossing such thresholds in the earth
system or in interlinked human and natural systems increases with
rising temperature (medium confidence). {WGII SPM B-1}
Adaptation can substantially reduce the risks of climate change
impacts, but greater rates and magnitude of climate change
increase the likelihood of exceeding adaptation limits (high
confidence). The potential for adaptation, as well as constraints and
limits to adaptation, varies among sectors, regions, communities and
ecosystems. The scope for adaptation changes over time and is closely
linked to socio-economic development pathways and circumstances.

2.3.1 Ecosystems and their services in the oceans,
along coasts, on land and in freshwater
Risks of harmful impacts on ecosystems and human systems
increase with the rates and magnitudes of warming, ocean
acidification, sea level rise and other dimensions of climate
change (high confidence). Future risk is indicated to be high by the
observation that natural global climate change at rates lower than
current anthropogenic climate change caused significant ecosystem
shifts and species extinctions during the past millions of years on land
and in the oceans (high confidence). Many plant and animal species
will be unable to adapt locally or move fast enough during the
21st century to track suitable climates under mid- and high range rates
of climate change (RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) (medium confidence)
(Figure 2.5a). Coral reefs and polar ecosystems are highly vulnerable.
{WGII SPM A-1, SPM B-2, 4.3–4, 5.4, 6.1, 6.3, 6.5, 25.6, 26.4, 29.4,
Box CC-CR, Box CC-MB, Box CC-RF}
A large fraction of terrestrial, freshwater and marine species
faces increased extinction risk due to climate change during and
beyond the 21st century, especially as climate change interacts
with other stressors (high confidence). Extinction risk is increased
relative to pre-industrial and present periods, under all RCP scenarios,
as a result of both the magnitude and rate of climate change (high
confidence). Extinctions will be driven by several climate-associated
drivers (warming, sea-ice loss, variations in precipitation, reduced river
flows, ocean acidification and lowered ocean oxygen levels) and the
interactions among these drivers and their interaction with simul-
taneous habitat modification, over-exploitation of stocks, pollution,
eutrophication and invasive species (high confidence). {WGII SPM B-2,
4.3–4.4, 6.1, 6.3, 6.5, 25.6, 26.4, Box CC-RF, Box CC-MB}
Global marine species redistribution and marine biodiversity
reduction in sensitive regions, under climate change, will chal-
lenge the sustained provision of fisheries productivity and
other ecosystem services, especially at low latitudes (high con-
fidence). By the mid-21st century, under 2°C global warming rela-
tive to pre-industrial temperatures, shifts in the geographical range
of marine species will cause species richness and fisheries catch
potential to increase, on average, at mid and high latitudes (high con-
fidence) and to decrease at tropical latitudes and in semi-enclosed
seas (Figure 2.6a) (medium confidence). The progressive expansion of
Oxygen Minimum Zones and anoxic ‘dead zones’ in the oceans will
further constrain fish habitats (medium confidence). Open-ocean net
primary production is projected to redistribute and to decrease globally,
by 2100, under all RCP scenarios (medium confidence). Climate change
adds to the threats of over-fishing and other non-climatic stressors
(high confidence). {WGII SPM B-2, 6.3–6.5, 7.4, 25.6, 28.3, 29.3,
30.6–30.7, Box CC-MB, Box CC-PP}
Marine ecosystems, especially coral reefs and polar ecosystems,
are at risk from ocean acidification (medium to high confidence).
Ocean acidification has impacts on the physiology, behaviour and pop-
ulation dynamics of organisms. The impacts on individual species and
the number of species affected in species groups increase from RCP4.5
to RCP8.5. Highly calcified molluscs, echinoderms and reef-building
corals are more sensitive than crustaceans (high confidence) and
fishes (low confidence) (Figure 2.6b). Ocean acidification acts together
with other global changes (e.g., warming, progressively lower oxygen
levels) and with local changes (e.g., pollution, eutrophication) (high
confidence), leading to interactive, complex and amplified impacts for
species and ecosystems (Figure 2.5b). {WGII SPM B-2, Figure SPM.6B,
5.4, 6.3.2, 6.3.5, 22.3, 25.6, 28.3, 30.5, Figure 6-10, Box CC-CR,
Box CC-OA, Box TS.7}
Carbon stored in the terrestrial biosphere is susceptible to loss
to the atmosphere as a result of climate change, deforestation
and ecosystem degradation (high confidence). The aspects of cli-
mate change with direct effects on stored terrestrial carbon include
high temperatures, drought and windstorms; indirect effects include
increased risk of fires, pest and disease outbreaks. Increased tree
mortality and associated forest dieback is projected to occur in many
regions over the 21st century (medium confidence), posing risks for
carbon storage, biodiversity, wood production, water quality, amen-
ity and economic activity. There is a high risk of substantial carbon
and methane emissions as a result of permafrost thawing. {WGII SPM,
4.2–4.3, Figure 4-8, Box 4-2, Box 4-3, Box 4-4}
Coastal systems and low-lying areas will increasingly experience
submergence, flooding and erosion throughout the 21st century
and beyond, due to sea level rise (very high confidence). The
population and assets projected to be exposed to coastal risks as well
as human pressures on coastal ecosystems will increase significantly in
the coming decades due to population growth, economic development
and urbanization (high confidence). Climatic and non-climatic drivers
affecting coral reefs will erode habitats, increase coastline exposure
to waves and storms and degrade environmental features important
to fisheries and tourism (high confidence). Some low-lying develop-
ing countries and small island states are expected to face very high
impacts that could have associated damage and adaptation costs
of several percentage points of gross domestic product (GDP)
(Figure 2.5c). {WGII 5.3–5.5, 22.3, 24.4, 25.6, 26.3, 26.8, 29.4,
Table 26-1, Box 25-1, Box CC-CR}

2.3.2 Water, food and urban systems, human
health, security and livelihoods
The fractions of the global population that will experience
water scarcity and be affected by major river floods are pro-
jected to increase with the level of warming in the 21st century
(robust evidence, high agreement). {WGII 3.4–3.5, 26.3, 29.4,
Table 3-2, Box 25-8}
Climate change over the 21st century is projected to reduce
renewable surface water and groundwater resources in most
dry subtropical regions (robust evidence, high agreement),
intensifying competition for water among sectors (limited evi-
dence, medium agreement). In presently dry regions, the frequency
of droughts will likely increase by the end of the 21st century under
RCP8.5 (medium confidence). In contrast, water resources are pro-
jected to increase at high latitudes (robust evidence, high agreement).
The interaction of increased temperature; increased sediment, nutrient
and pollutant loadings from heavy rainfall; increased concentrations
of pollutants during droughts; and disruption of treatment facilities
during floods will reduce raw water quality and pose risks to drinking
water quality (medium evidence, high agreement). {WGI 12.4, WGII 3.2,
3.4–3.6, 22.3, 23.9, 25.5, 26.3, Table 3-2, Table 23-3, Box 25-2, Box CC-RF,
Box CC-WE}
All aspects of food security are potentially affected by climate
change, including food production, access, use and price sta-
bility (high confidence). For wheat, rice and maize in tropical and
temperate regions, climate change without adaptation is projected to
negatively impact production at local temperature increases of 2°C or
more above late 20th century levels, although individual locations may
benefit (medium confidence). Projected impacts vary across crops and
regions and adaptation scenarios, with about 10% of projections for
the 2030–2049 period showing yield gains of more than 10%, and
about 10% of projections showing yield losses of more than 25%, com-
pared with the late 20th century. Global temperature increases of ~4°C
or more above late 20th century levels, combined with increasing food
demand, would pose large risks to food security, both globally and
regionally (high confidence) (Figure 2.4, 2.7). The relationship between
global and regional warming is explained in 2.2.1. {WGII 6.3–6.5,
7.4–7.5, 9.3, 22.3, 24.4, 25.7, 26.5, Table 7-2, Table 7-3, Figure 7-1,
Figure 7-4, Figure 7-5, Figure 7-6, Figure 7-7, Figure 7-8, Box 7-1}
Until mid-century, projected climate change will impact human
health mainly by exacerbating health problems that already
exist (very high confidence). Throughout the 21st century,
climate change is expected to lead to increases in ill-health in
many regions and especially in developing countries with low
income, as compared to a baseline without climate change
(high confidence). Health impacts include greater likelihood of injury
and death due to more intense heat waves and fires, increased risks
from foodborne and waterborne diseases and loss of work capacity
and reduced labour productivity in vulnerable populations (high confi-
dence). Risks of undernutrition in poor regions will increase (high con-
fidence). Risks from vector-borne diseases are projected to generally
increase with warming, due to the extension of the infection area and
season, despite reductions in some areas that become too hot for dis-
ease vectors (medium confidence). Globally, the magnitude and sever-
ity of negative impacts will increasingly outweigh positive impacts
(high confidence). By 2100 for RCP8.5, the combination of high tem-
perature and humidity in some areas for parts of the year is expected
to compromise common human activities, including growing food and
working outdoors (high confidence). {WGII SPM B-2, 8.2, 11.3–11.8,
19.3, 22.3, 25.8, 26.6, Figure 25-5, Box CC-HS}
In urban areas, climate change is projected to increase risks for
people, assets, economies and ecosystems, including risks from
heat stress, storms and extreme precipitation, inland and coastal
flooding, landslides, air pollution, drought, water scarcity, sea
level rise and storm surges (very high confidence). These risks
will be amplified for those lacking essential infrastructure and services
or living in exposed areas. {WGII 3.5, 8.2–8.4, 22.3, 24.4–24.5, 26.8,
Table 8-2, Box 25-9, Box CC-HS}
Rural areas are expected to experience major impacts on
water availability and supply, food security, infrastructure
and agricultural incomes, including shifts in the production
areas of food and non-food crops around the world (high
confidence). These impacts will disproportionately affect the wel-
fare of the poor in rural areas, such as female-headed households
and those with limited access to land, modern agricultural inputs,
infrastructure and education. {WGII 5.4, 9.3, 25.9, 26.8, 28.2, 28.4,
Box 25-5}
Aggregate economic losses accelerate with increasing tempera-
ture (limited evidence, high agreement), but global economic
impacts from climate change are currently difficult to estimate.
With recognized limitations, the existing incomplete estimates of global
annual economic losses for warming of ~2.5°C above pre-industrial
levels are 0.2 to 2.0% of income (medium evidence, medium agree-
ment). Changes in population, age structure, income, technology, rela-
tive prices, lifestyle, regulation and governance are projected to have
relatively larger impacts than climate change, for most economic sec-
tors (medium evidence, high agreement). More severe and/or frequent
weather hazards are projected to increase disaster-related losses and
loss variability, posing challenges for affordable insurance, particularly
in developing countries. International dimensions such as trade and
relations among states are also important for understanding the risks
of climate change at regional scales. (Box 3.1) {WGII 3.5, 10.2, 10.7,
10.9–10.10, 17.4–17.5, 25.7, 26.7–26.9, Box 25-7}
From a poverty perspective, climate change impacts are pro-
jected to slow down economic growth, make poverty reduction
more difficult, further erode food security and prolong exist-
ing poverty traps and create new ones, the latter particularly in
urban areas and emerging hotspots of hunger (medium confi-
dence). Climate change impacts are expected to exacerbate poverty in
most developing countries and create new poverty pockets in countries
with increasing inequality, in both developed and developing countries
(Figure 2.4). {WGII 8.1, 8.3–8.4, 9.3, 10.9, 13.2–13.4, 22.3, 26.8}
Climate change is projected to increase displacement of people
(medium evidence, high agreement). Displacement risk increases
when populations that lack the resources for planned migration expe-
rience higher exposure to extreme weather events, such as floods and
droughts. Expanding opportunities for mobility can reduce vulnerability
for such populations. Changes in migration patterns can be responses
to both extreme weather events and longer term climate variability and
change, and migration can also be an effective adaptation strategy.
{WGII 9.3, 12.4, 19.4, 22.3, 25.9}
Climate change can indirectly increase risks of violent conflict
by amplifying well-documented drivers of these conflicts, such
as poverty and economic shocks (medium confidence). Multiple
lines of evidence relate climate variability to some forms of conflict.
{WGII SPM, 12.5, 13.2, 19.4}

2.4 Climate change beyond 2100,
irreversibility and abrupt changes
Many aspects of climate change and its associated
impacts will continue for centuries, even if anthropo-
genic emissions of greenhouse gases are stopped. The
risks of abrupt or irreversible changes increase as the
magnitude of the warming increases.
Warming will continue beyond 2100 under all RCP scenarios
except RCP2.6. Surface temperatures will remain approximately con-
stant at elevated levels for many centuries after a complete cessation
of net anthropogenic CO2 emissions (see Section 2.2.5 for the relation-
ship between CO2 emissions and global temperature change.). A large
fraction of anthropogenic climate change resulting from CO2 emissions
is irreversible on a multi-century to millennial timescale, except in the
case of a large net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere over a sus-
tained period (Figure 2.8a, b). {WGI SPM E.1, SPM E.8, 12.5.2}
Stabilization of global average surface temperature does not
imply stabilization for all aspects of the climate system. Shifting
biomes, re-equilibrating soil carbon, ice sheets, ocean temperatures
and associated sea level rise all have their own intrinsic long times-
cales that will result in ongoing changes for hundreds to thousands
of years after global surface temperature has been stabilized. {WGI
SPM E.8, 12.5.2–12.5.4, WGII 4.2}
Ocean acidification will continue for centuries if CO2 emissions
continue, it will strongly affect marine ecosystems (high
confidence), and the impact will be exacerbated by rising
temperature extremes (Figure 2.5b). {WGI 3.8.2, 6.4.4, WGII
SPM B-2, 6.3.2, 6.3.5, 30.5, Box CC-OA}
Global mean sea level rise will continue for many centuries
beyond 2100 (virtually certain). The few available analyses that go
beyond 2100 indicate sea level rise to be less than 1 m above the
pre-industrial level by 2300 for GHG concentrations that peak and
decline and remain below 500 ppm CO2-eq, as in scenario RCP2.6. For
a radiative forcing that corresponds to a CO2-eq concentration in 2100
that is above 700 ppm but below 1500 ppm, as in scenario RCP8.5, the
projected rise is 1 m to more than 3 m by 2300 (medium confidence)
(Figure 2.8c). There is low confidence in the available models’ ability
to project solid ice discharge from the Antarctic ice sheet. Hence,
these models likely underestimate the Antarctica ice sheet contribu-
tion, resulting in an underestimation of projected sea level rise beyond
2100. {WGI SPM E.8, 13.4.4, 13.5.4}
There is little evidence in global climate models of a tipping point or
critical threshold in the transition from a perennially ice-covered to a
seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean, beyond which further sea-ice loss is
unstoppable and irreversible. {WGI 12.5.5}
There is low confidence in assessing the evolution of the Atlantic
Meridional Overturning Circulation beyond the 21st century because
of the limited number of analyses and equivocal results. However, a
collapse beyond the 21st century for large sustained warming cannot
be excluded. {WGI SPM E.4, 12.4.7, 12.5.5}
Sustained mass loss by ice sheets would cause larger sea level
rise, and part of the mass loss might be irreversible. There is
high confidence that sustained global mean warming greater than a
threshold would lead to the near-complete loss of the Greenland ice
sheet over a millennium or more, causing a sea level rise of up to 7 m.
Current estimates indicate that the threshold is greater than about
1°C (low confidence) but less than about 4°C (medium confidence)
of global warming with respect to pre-industrial temperatures. Abrupt
and irreversible ice loss from a potential instability of marine-based
sectors of the Antarctic ice sheet in response to climate forcing is pos-
sible, but current evidence and understanding is insufficient to make
a quantitative assessment. {WGI SPM E.8, 5.6.2, 5.8.1, 13.4.3, 13.5.4}
Within the 21st century, magnitudes and rates of climate change
associated with medium to high emission scenarios (RCP4.5,
RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) pose a high risk of abrupt and irreversible
regional-scale change in the composition, structure and function
of marine, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, including wet-
lands (medium confidence), as well as warm water coral reefs
(high confidence). Examples that could substantially amplify climate
change are the boreal-tundra Arctic system (medium confidence) and
the Amazon forest (low confidence). {WGII 4.3.3.1, Box 4.3, Box 4.4,
5.4.2.4, 6.3.1–6.3.4, 6.4.2, 30.5.3–30.5.6, Box CC-CR, Box CC-MB}
A reduction in permafrost extent is virtually certain with contin-
ued rise in global temperatures. Current permafrost areas are pro-
jected to become a net emitter of carbon (CO2 and CH4) with a loss of
180 to 920 GtCO2 (50 to 250 GtC) under RCP8.5 over the 21st century
(low confidence). {WGI TFE.5, 6.4.3.4, 12.5.5, WGII 4.3.3.4}

opic 3: Future Pathways for Adaption, Mitigation and Sustainable Development
Adaptation and mitigation are complementary strategies for reducing and managing the risks of climate change. Sub-
stantial emissions reductions over the next few decades can reduce climate risks in the 21st century and beyond, increase
prospects for effective adaptation, reduce the costs and challenges of mitigation in the longer term and contribute to
climate-resilient pathways for sustainable development.
Adaptation and mitigation are two complementary strategies for responding to climate change. Adaptation is the process of adjustment to actual
or expected climate and its effects in order to either lessen or avoid harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. Mitigation is the process of reducing
emissions or enhancing sinks of greenhouse gases (GHGs), so as to limit future climate change. Both adaptation and mitigation can reduce and
manage the risks of climate change impacts. Yet adaptation and mitigation can also create other risks, as well as benefits. Strategic responses
to climate change involve consideration of climate-related risks along with the risks and co-benefits of adaptation and mitigation actions. {WGII
SPM A-3, SPM C, Glossary, WGIII SPM.2, 4.1, 5.1, Glossary}
Mitigation, adaptation and climate impacts can all result in transformations to and changes in systems. Depending on the rate and magnitude
of change and the vulnerability and exposure of human and natural systems, climate change will alter ecosystems, food systems, infrastructure,
coastal, urban and rural areas, human health and livelihoods. Adaptive responses to a changing climate require actions that range from incre-
mental changes to more fundamental, transformational changes34.20Mitigation can involve fundamental changes in the way that human societies
produce and use energy services and land. {WGII B, C, TS C, Box TS.8, Glossary, WGIII SPM.4}
Topic 3 of this report examines the factors that influence the assessment of mitigation and adaptation strategies. It considers the benefits, risks,
incremental changes and potential transformations from different combinations of mitigation, adaptation and residual climate-related impacts. It
considers how responses in the coming decades will influence options for limiting long-term climate change and opportunities for adapting to it. Finally,
it considers factors—including uncertainty, ethical considerations and links to other societal goals—that may influence choices about mitigation
and adaptation. Topic 4 then assesses the prospects for mitigation and adaptation on the basis of current knowledge of tools, options and policies.

3.1 Foundations of decision-making
about climate change
Effective decision-making to limit climate change and
its effects can be informed by a wide range of ana-
lytical approaches for evaluating expected risks and
benefits, recognizing the importance of governance,
ethical dimensions, equity, value judgments, economic
assessments and diverse perceptions and responses to
risk and uncertainty.
Sustainable development and equity provide a basis for assess-
ing climate policies. Limiting the effects of climate change is
necessary to achieve sustainable development and equity,
including poverty eradication. Countries’ past and future contribu-
tions to the accumulation of GHGs in the atmosphere are different, and
countries also face varying challenges and circumstances and have dif-
ferent capacities to address mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation and
adaptation raise issues of equity, justice and fairness and are necessary
to achieve sustainable development and poverty eradication. Many
of those most vulnerable to climate change have contributed and
contribute little to GHG emissions. Delaying mitigation shifts burdens
from the present to the future, and insufficient adaptation responses to
emerging impacts are already eroding the basis for sustainable
development. Both adaptation and mitigation can have distributional
effects locally, nationally and internationally, depending on who
pays and who benefits. The process of decision-making about climate
change, and the degree to which it respects the rights and views of
all those affected, is also a concern of justice. {WGII 2.2, 2.3, 13.3,
13.4, 17.3, 20.2, 20.5, WGIII SPM.2, 3.3, 3.10, 4.1.2, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5,
4.6, 4.8}
Effective mitigation will not be achieved if individual agents
advance their own interests independently. Climate change has
the characteristics of a collective action problem at the global scale,
because most GHGs accumulate over time and mix globally, and emis-
sions by any agent (e.g., individual, community, company, country)
affect other agents. Cooperative responses, including international
cooperation, are therefore required to effectively mitigate GHG emis-
sions and address other climate change issues. The effectiveness of
adaptation can be enhanced through complementary actions across
levels, including international cooperation. The evidence suggests
that outcomes seen as equitable can lead to more effective cooper-
ation. {WGII 20.3.1, WGIII SPM.2, TS.1, 1.2, 2.6, 3.2, 4.2, 13.2, 13.3}
Decision-making about climate change involves valuation and
mediation among diverse values and may be aided by the ana-
lytic methods of several normative disciplines. Ethics analyses
the different values involved and the relations between them. Recent
political philosophy has investigated the question of responsibility for
the effects of emissions. Economics and decision analysis provide
quantitative methods of valuation which can be used for estima-
ting the social cost of carbon (see Box 3.1), in cost–benefit and cost-
effectiveness analyses, for optimization in integrated models and
elsewhere. Economic methods can reflect ethical principles, and take
account of non-marketed goods, equity, behavioural biases, ancil-
lary benefits and costs and the differing values of money to different
people. They are, however, subject to well-documented limitations.
{WGII 2.2, 2.3, WGIII SPM.2, Box TS.2, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 3.2–3.6, 3.9.4}
Analytical methods of valuation cannot identify a single best
balance between mitigation, adaptation and residual climate
impacts. Important reasons for this are that climate change involves
extremely complex natural and social processes, there is extensive dis-
agreement about the values concerned, and climate change impacts
and mitigation approaches have important distributional effects. Nev-
ertheless, information on the consequences of emissions pathways
to alternative climate goals and risk levels can be a useful input into
decision-making processes. Evaluating responses to climate change
involves assessment of the widest possible range of impacts, including
low-probability outcomes with large consequences. {WGII 1.1.4, 2.3,
2.4, 17.3, 19.6, 19.7, WGIII 2.5, 2.6, 3.4, 3.7, Box 3-9}
Effective decision-making and risk management in the complex
environment of climate change may be iterative: strategies can
often be adjusted as new information and understanding devel-
ops during implementation. However, adaptation and mitigation
choices in the near term will affect the risks of climate change through-
out the 21st century and beyond, and prospects for climate-resilient
pathways for sustainable development depend on what is achieved
through mitigation. Opportunities to take advantage of positive syn-
ergies between adaptation and mitigation may decrease with time,
particularly if mitigation is delayed too long. Decision-making about
climate change is influenced by how individuals and organizations per-
ceive risks and uncertainties and take them into account. They some-
times use simplified decision rules, overestimate or underestimate risks
and are biased towards the status quo. They differ in their degree of
risk aversion and the relative importance placed on near-term versus
long-term ramifications of specific actions. Formalized analytical meth-
ods for decision-making under uncertainty can account accurately for
risk, and focus attention on both short- and long-term consequences.

3.2 Climate change risks reduced by
adaptation and mitigation
Without additional mitigation efforts beyond those in
place today, and even with adaptation, warming by the
end of the 21st century will lead to high to very high
risk of severe, widespread and irreversible impacts
globally (high confidence). Mitigation involves some
level of co-benefits and of risks due to adverse side
effects, but these risks do not involve the same pos-
sibility of severe, widespread and irreversible impacts
as risks from climate change, increasing the benefits
from near-term mitigation efforts.
The risks of climate change, adaptation and mitigation differ in
nature, timescale, magnitude and persistence (high confidence).
Risks from adaptation include maladaptation and negative ancillary
impacts. Risks from mitigation include possible adverse side effects
of large-scale deployment of low-carbon technology options and eco-
nomic costs. Climate change risks may persist for millennia and can
involve very high risk of severe impacts and the presence of significant
irreversibilities combined with limited adaptive capacity. In contrast,
the stringency of climate policies can be adjusted much more quickly
in response to observed consequences and costs and create lower risks
of irreversible consequences (3.3, 3.4, 4.3). {WGI SPM E.8, 12.4, 12.5.2,
13.5, WGII 4.2, 17.2, 19.6, WGIII TS.3.1.4, Table TS.4, Table TS.5,
Table TS.6, Table TS.7, Table TS.8, 2.5, 6.6}
Mitigation and adaptation are complementary approaches for
reducing risks of climate change impacts. They interact with one
another and reduce risks over different timescales (high confi-
dence). Benefits from adaptation can already be realized in addressing
current risks and can be realized in the future for addressing emerging
risks. Adaptation has the potential to reduce climate change impacts
over the next few decades, while mitigation has relatively little influ-
ence on climate outcomes over this timescale. Near-term and longer-
term mitigation and adaptation, as well as development pathways, will
determine the risks of climate change beyond mid-century. The poten-
tial for adaptation differs across sectors and will be limited by institu-
tional and capacity constraints, increasing the long-term benefits of
mitigation (high confidence). The level of mitigation will influence the
rate and magnitude of climate change, and greater rates and magni-
tude of climate change increase the likelihood of exceeding adaptation
limits (high confidence) (3.3). {WGI 11.3, 12.4, WGII SPM A-3, SPM B-2,
SPM C-2, 1.1.4.4, 2.5, 16.3–16.6, 17.3, 19.2, 20.2.3, 20.3, 20.6}
Without additional mitigation efforts beyond those in place
today, and even with adaptation, warming by the end of the
21st century will lead to high to very high risk of severe, wide-
spread and irreversible impacts globally (high confidence)
(Topic 2 and Figure 3.1a). Estimates of warming in 2100 without
additional climate mitigation efforts are from 3.7°C to 4.8°C compared
with pre-industrial levels (median climate response); the range is 2.5°C
to 7.8°C when using the 5th to 95th percentile range of the median
climate response (Figure 3.1). The risks associated with temperatures
at or above 4°C include severe and widespread impacts on unique and
threatened systems, substantial species extinction, large risks to global
and regional food security, consequential constraints on common
human activities, increased likelihood of triggering tipping points (criti-
cal thresholds) and limited potential for adaptation in some cases (high
confidence). Some risks of climate change, such as risks to unique and
threatened systems and risks associated with extreme weather events,
are moderate to high at temperatures 1°C to 2°C above pre-industrial
levels. {WGII SPM B-1, SPM C-2, WGIII SPM.3}
Substantial cuts in GHG emissions over the next few decades
can substantially reduce risks of climate change by limiting
warming in the second half of the 21st century and beyond
(high confidence). Global mean surface warming is largely deter-
mined by cumulative emissions, which are, in turn, linked to emissions
over different timescales (Figure 3.1). Limiting risks across Reasons
For Concern would imply a limit for cumulative emissions of CO2.
Such a limit would require that global net emissions of CO2 even-
tually decrease to zero (Figure 3.1a,b) (high confidence). Reducing
risks of climate change through mitigation would involve substan-
tial cuts in GHG emissions over the next few decades (Figure 3.1c).
But some risks from residual damages are unavoidable, even with
mitigation and adaptation (very high confidence). A subset of relevant
climate change risks has been estimated using aggregate economic
indicators. Such economic estimates have important limitations and
are therefore a useful but insufficient basis for decision-making on
long-term mitigation targets (see Box 3.1). {WGII 19.7.1, WGIII SPM.3,
Figure 3.1}
Mitigation involves some level of co-benefits and risks, but these
risks do not involve the same possibility of severe, widespread
and irreversible impacts as risks from climate change (high con-
fidence). Scenarios that are likely to limit warming to below 2°C or
even 3°C compared with pre-industrial temperatures involve large-scale
changes in energy systems and potentially land use over the coming
decades (3.4). Associated risks include those linked to large-scale
deployment of technology options for producing low-carbon energy, the
potential for high aggregate economic costs of mitigation and impacts
on vulnerable countries and industries. Other risks and co-benefits are
associated with human health, food security, energy security, poverty
reduction, biodiversity conservation, water availability, income distri-
bution, efficiency of taxation systems, labour supply and employment,
urban sprawl, fossil fuel export revenues and the economic growth of
developing countries (Table 4.5). {WGIII SPM.4.1, SPM.4.2, TS.3.1.4,
Table TS.4, Table TS.5, Table TS.6, Table TS.7, Table TS.8, 6.6}
Inertia in the economic and climate systems and the possibil-
ity of irreversible impacts from climate change increase the
benefits of near-term mitigation efforts (high confidence). The
actions taken today affect the options available in the future to reduce
emissions, limit temperature change and adapt to climate change.
Near-term choices can create, amplify or limit significant elements of
lock-in that are important for decision-making. Lock-ins and irrevers-
ibilities occur in the climate system due to large inertia in some of its
components such as heat transfer from the ocean surface to depth
leading to continued ocean warming for centuries regardless of emis-
sion scenario and the irreversibility of a large fraction of anthropogenic
climate change resulting from CO2 emissions on a multi-century to mil-
lennial timescale unless CO2 were to be removed from the atmosphere
through large-scale human interventions over a sustained period (see
also Box 3.3). Irreversibilities in socio-economic and biological systems
also result from infrastructure development and long-lived products
and from climate change impacts, such as species extinction. The
larger potential for irreversibility and pervasive impacts from climate
change risks than from mitigation risks increases the benefit of short-
term mitigation efforts. Delays in additional mitigation or constraints
on technological options limit the mitigation options and increase the
long-term mitigation costs as well as other risks that would be incurred
in the medium to long term to hold climate change impacts at a given
level (Table WGIII SPM.2, blue segment). {WGI SPM E-8, WGII SPM B-2,
2.1, 19.7, 20.3, Box 20-4, WGIII SPM.4.1, SPM.4.2.1, 3.6, 6.4, 6.6, 6.9}

3.3 Characteristics of adaptation pathways
Adaptation can reduce the risks of climate change
impacts, but there are limits to its effectiveness, espe-
cially with greater magnitudes and rates of climate
change. Taking a longer-term perspective, in the con-
text of sustainable development, increases the likeli-
hood that more immediate adaptation actions will
also enhance future options and preparedness.
Adaptation can contribute to the well-being of current and
future populations, the security of assets and the maintenance
of ecosystem goods, functions and services now and in the
future. Adaptation is place- and context-specific, with no single
approach for reducing risks appropriate across all settings (high
confidence). Effective risk reduction and adaptation strategies con-
sider vulnerability and exposure and their linkages with socio-economic
processes, sustainable development, and climate change. Adaptation
research since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) has evolved
from a dominant consideration of engineering and technological adap-
tation pathways to include more ecosystem-based, institutional and
social measures. A previous focus on cost–benefit analysis, optimiza-
tion and efficiency approaches has broadened with the development of
multi-metric evaluations that include risk and uncertainty dimensions
integrated within wider policy and ethical frameworks to assess trade-
offs and constraints. The range of specific adaptation measures has
also expanded (4.2, 4.4.2.1), as have the links to sustainable devel-
opment (3.5). There are many studies on local and sectoral adaptation
costs and benefits, but few global analyses and very low confidence
in their results. {WGII SPM C-1, Table SPM.1, 14.1, 14.ES, 15.2, 15.5,
17.2, 17.ES}
Adaptation planning and implementation at all levels of gov-
ernance are contingent on societal values, objectives and risk
perceptions (high confidence). Recognition of diverse interests,
circumstances, social-cultural contexts and expectations can benefit
decision-making processes. Indigenous, local and traditional knowl-
edge systems and practices, including indigenous peoples’ holistic
view of community and environment, are a major resource for adapt-
ing to climate change, but these have not been used consistently
in existing adaptation efforts. Integrating such forms of knowledge
into practices increases the effectiveness of adaptation as do effec-
tive decision support, engagement and policy processes (4.4.2). {WGII
SPM C-1}
Adaptation planning and implementation can be enhanced
through complementary actions across levels, from individu-
als to governments (high confidence). National governments can
coordinate adaptation efforts of local and sub-national governments,
for example by protecting vulnerable groups, by supporting economic
diversification and by providing information, policy and legal frame-
works and financial support (robust evidence, high agreement). Local
government and the private sector are increasingly recognized as crit-
ical to progress in adaptation, given their roles in scaling up adapta-
tion of communities, households and civil society and in managing risk
information and financing (medium evidence, high agreement). {WGII
SPM C-1}
A first step towards adaptation to future climate change is
reducing vulnerability and exposure to present climate variabil-
ity (high confidence), but some near-term responses to climate
change may also limit future choices. Integration of adaptation
into planning, including policy design, and decision-making can pro-
mote synergies with development and disaster risk reduction. How-
ever, poor planning or implementation, overemphasizing short-term
outcomes or failing to sufficiently anticipate consequences can result
in maladaptation, increasing the vulnerability or exposure of the target
group in the future or the vulnerability of other people, places or sec-
tors (medium evidence, high agreement). For example, enhanced pro-
tection of exposed assets can lock in dependence on further protection
measures. Appropriate adaptation options can be better assessed by
including co-benefits and mitigation implications (3.5 and 4.2). {WGII
SPM C-1}
Numerous interacting constraints can impede adaptation plan-
ning and implementation (high confidence). Common constraints
on implementation arise from the following: limited financial and
human resources; limited integration or coordination of governance;
uncertainties about projected impacts; different perceptions of risks;
competing values; absence of key adaptation leaders and advocates;
and limited tools to monitor adaptation effectiveness. Other con-
straints include insufficient research, monitoring and observation and
the financial and other resources to maintain them. Underestimating
the complexity of adaptation as a social process can create unrealis-
tic expectations about achieving intended adaptation outcomes (see
Sections 4.1 and 4.2 for details in relation to implementation). {WGII
SPM C-1}
Greater rates and magnitude of climate change increase the
likelihood of exceeding adaptation limits (high confidence).
Limits to adaptation occur when adaptive actions to avoid intolera-
ble risks for an actor’s objectives or for the needs of a system are not
possible or are not currently available. Value-based judgments of what
constitutes an intolerable risk may differ. Limits to adaptation emerge
from the interaction among climate change and biophysical and/or
socio-economic constraints. Opportunities to take advantage of positive
synergies between adaptation and mitigation may decrease with time,
particularly if limits to adaptation are exceeded. In some parts of the
world, insufficient responses to emerging impacts are already eroding
the basis for sustainable development. For most regions and sectors,
empirical evidence is not sufficient to quantify magnitudes of climate
change that would constitute a future adaptation limit. Furthermore,
economic development, technology and cultural norms and values can
change over time to enhance or reduce the capacity of systems to avoid
limits. As a consequence, some limits are ‘soft’ in that they may be alle-
viated over time. Other limits are ‘hard’ in that there are no reasonable
prospects for avoiding intolerable risks. {WGII SPM C-2, TS}
Transformations in economic, social, technological and political
decisions and actions can enhance adaptation and promote sus-
tainable development (high confidence). Restricting adaptation
responses to incremental changes to existing systems and structures
without considering transformational change may increase costs and
losses and miss opportunities. For example, enhancing infrastructure to
protect other built assets can be expensive and ultimately not defray
increasing costs and risks, whereas options such as relocation or using
ecosystem services to adapt may provide a range of benefits now and
in the future. Transformational adaptation can include introduction of
new technologies or practices, formation of new financial structures
or systems of governance, adaptation at greater scales or magnitudes
and shifts in the location of activities. Planning and implementation
of transformational adaptation could reflect strengthened, altered or
aligned paradigms and consequently may place new and increased
demands on governance structures to reconcile different goals and
visions for the future and to address possible equity and ethical impli-
cations: transformational adaptation pathways are enhanced by iter-
ative learning, deliberative processes, and innovation. At the national
level, transformation is considered most effective when it reflects a
country’s own visions and approaches to achieving sustainable devel-
opment in accordance with its national circumstances and priorities.
{WGII SPM C-2, 1.1, 2.5, 5.5, 8.4, 14.1, 14.3, 16.2-7, 20.3.3, 20.5,
25.10, Table 14-4, Table 16-3, Box 16.1, Box 16.4, Box 25.1}
Building adaptive capacity is crucial for effective selection
and implementation of adaptation options (robust evidence,
high agreement). Successful adaptation requires not only identi-
fying adaptation options and assessing their costs and benefits, but
also increasing the adaptive capacity of human and natural systems
(medium evidence, high agreement). This can involve complex govern-
ance challenges and new institutions and institutional arrangements.
(4.2) {WGII 8.1, 12.3, 14.1-3, 16.2, 16.3, 16.5, 16.8}
Significant co-benefits, synergies and trade-offs exist between
mitigation and adaptation and among different adaptation
responses; interactions occur both within and across regions (very
high confidence). Increasing efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate
change imply an increasing complexity of interactions, particularly at the
intersections among water, energy, land use and biodiversity, but tools to
understand and manage these interactions remain limited. Examples of
actions with co-benefits include (i) improved energy efficiency and cleaner
energy sources, leading to reduced emissions of health-damaging,
climate-altering air pollutants; (ii) reduced energy and water consump-
tion in urban areas through greening cities and recycling water; (iii)
sustainable agriculture and forestry; and (iv) protection of ecosystems
for carbon storage and other ecosystem services. {WGII SPM C-1}

3.4 Characteristics of mitigation pathways
There are multiple mitigation pathways that are likely
to limit warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial
levels. These pathways would require substantial emis-
sions reductions over the next few decades and near
zero emissions of CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse
gases by the end of the century. Implementing such
reductions poses substantial technological, economic,
social and institutional challenges, which increase
with delays in additional mitigation and if key tech-
nologies are not available. Limiting warming to lower
or higher levels involves similar challenges but on
different timescales.
Without additional efforts to reduce GHG emissions beyond
those in place today, global emission growth is expected to
persist driven by growth in global population and economic
activities (high confidence) (Figure 3.2). Global GHG emissions
under most scenarios without additional mitigation (baseline scenar-
ios) are between about 75 GtCO2-eq/yr and almost 140 GtCO2-eq/yr
in 21003520which is approximately between the 2100 emission levels
in the RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 pathways (Figure 3.2)3621
. Baseline scenarios
exceed 450 ppm CO2-eq by 2030 and reach CO2-eq concentration levels
between about 750 ppm CO2-eq and more than 1300 ppm CO2-eq by
2100. Global mean surface temperature increases in 2100 range from
about 3.7°C to 4.8°C above the average for 1850–1900 for a median
climate response. They range from 2.5°C to 7.8°C when including cli-
mate uncertainty (5th to 95th percentile range)3722
. The future scenarios
do not account for possible changes in natural forcings in the cli-
mate system (see Box 1.1). {WGIII SPM.3, SPM.4.1, TS.2.2, TS.3.1, 6.3,
Box TS.6}
Many different combinations of technological, behavioural and
policy options can be used to reduce emissions and limit tem-
perature change (high confidence). To evaluate possible pathways
to long-term climate goals, about 900 mitigation scenarios were col-
lected for this assessment, each of which describes different techno-
logical, socio-economic and institutional changes. Emission reductions
under these scenarios lead to concentrations in 2100 from 430 ppm
CO2-eq to above 720 ppm CO2-eq which is comparable to the 2100
forcing levels between RCP2.6 and RCP6.0. Scenarios with concen-
tration levels of below 430 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 were also assessed.
{WGIII SPM.4.1, TS3.1, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, Annex II}
Scenarios leading to CO2-eq concentrations in 2100 of about
450 ppm or lower are likely to maintain warming below 2°C over the
21st century relative to pre-industrial levels (high confidence). Miti-
gation scenarios reaching concentration levels of about 500 ppm CO2-eq
by 2100 are more likely than not to limit warming to less than 2°C
relative to pre-industrial levels, unless concentration levels temporarily
exceed roughly 530 ppm CO2-eq before 2100. In this case, warming
is about as likely as not to remain below 2°C relative to pre-industrial
levels. Scenarios that exceed about 650 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 are
unlikely to limit warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels.
Mitigation scenarios in which warming is more likely than not to be less
than 1.5°C relative to pre-industrial levels by 2100 are characterized
by concentration levels by 2100 of below 430 ppm CO2-eq. In these
scenarios, temperature peaks during the century and subsequently
declines (Table 3.1). {WGIII SPM.4.1, Table SPM.1, TS.3.1, Box TS.6, 6.3}
Mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 ppm CO2-eq in 2100
(consistent with a likely chance to keep warming below 2°C rel-
ative to pre-industrial level) typically involve temporary over-
shoot3823of atmospheric concentrations, as do many scenarios
reaching about 500 ppm CO2-eq to about 550 ppm CO2-eq by
2100 (Table 3.1). Depending on the level of overshoot, over-
shoot scenarios typically rely on the availability and wide-
spread deployment of bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture
and storage (BECCS) and afforestation in the second half of the
century (high confidence). The availability and scale of these and
other Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) technologies and methods are
uncertain, and CDR technologies and methods are, to varying degrees,
associated with challenges and risks (see Box 3.3)3924
. CDR is also prev-
alent in many scenarios without overshoot to compensate for residual
emissions from sectors where mitigation is more expensive. {WGIII
SPM.4.1, Table SPM.1, TS.3.1, 6.3, 6.9.1, Figure 6.7, 7.11, 11.13}
Limiting warming with a likely chance to less than 2°C rela-
tive to pre-industrial levels would require substantial cuts in
anthropogenic GHG emissions4025
by mid-century through large-
scale changes in energy systems and possibly land use. Limit-
ing warming to higher levels would require similar changes but
less quickly. Limiting warming to lower levels would require
these changes more quickly (high confidence). Scenarios that
are likely to maintain warming at below 2°C are characterized by a
40 to 70% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050, relative to 2010 levels,
and emissions levels near zero or below in 2100 (Figure 3.2, Table 3.1).
Scenarios with higher emissions in 2050 are characterized by a greater
reliance on CDR technologies beyond mid-century, and vice versa.
Scenarios that are likely to maintain warming at below 2°C include
more rapid improvements in energy efficiency and a tripling to nearly
a quadrupling of the share of zero- and low-carbon energy supply
from renewable energy, nuclear energy and fossil energy with carbon
dioxide capture and storage (CCS) or BECCS by the year 2050 (Figure 3.2b).
The scenarios describe a wide range of changes in land use, reflecting
different assumptions about the scale of bioenergy production, affores-
tation and reduced deforestation. Scenarios leading to concentra-
tions of 500 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 are characterized by a 25 to 55%
reduction in GHG emissions by 2050, relative to 2010 levels. Scenarios
that are likely to limit warming to 3°C relative to pre-industrial levels
reduce emissions less rapidly than those limiting warming to 2°C. Only a
limited number of studies provide scenarios that are more likely than not
to limit warming to 1.5°C by 2100; these scenarios are characterized
by concentrations below 430 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 and 2050 emis-
sion reduction between 70 and 95% below 2010. For a comprehen-
sive overview of the characteristics of emissions scenarios, their
CO2-equivalent concentrations and their likelihood to keep warming
to below a range of temperature levels, see Table 3.1. {WGIII SPM.4.1,
TS.3.1, 6.3, 7.11}
Reducing emissions of non-CO2 climate forcing agents can be
an important element of mitigation strategies. Emissions of non-
CO2 gases (methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated gases)
contributed about 27% to the total emissions of Kyoto gases in 2010.
For most non-CO2 gases, near-term, low-cost options are available to
reduce their emissions. However, some sources of these non-CO2 gases
are difficult to mitigate, such as N2O emissions from fertilizer use and
CH4 emissions from livestock. As a result, emissions of most non-CO2
gases will not be reduced to zero, even under stringent mitigation
scenarios (see Figure 4.1). The differences in radiative properties and
lifetimes of CO2 and non-CO2 climate forcing agents have important
implications for mitigation strategies (see also Box 3.2). {WGIII 6.3.2}
All current GHG emissions and other climate forcing agents
affect the rate and magnitude of climate change over the next
few decades. Reducing the emissions of certain short-lived climate
forcing agents can reduce the rate of warming in the short term
but will have only a limited effect on long-term warming, which is
driven mainly by CO2 emissions. There are large uncertainties related
to the climate impacts of some of the short-lived climate forcing
agents. Although the effects of CH4 emissions are well understood,
there are large uncertainties related to the effects of black carbon.
Co-emitted components with cooling effects may further complicate
and reduce the climate impacts of emission reductions. Reducing emis-
sions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) would cause warming. Near-term reduc-
tions in short-lived climate forcing agents can have a relatively fast
impact on climate change and possible co-benefits for air pollution.
{WGI 8.2.3, 8.3.2, 8.3.4, 8.5.1, 8.7.2, FAQ 8.2, 12.5, WGIII 6.6.2.1}
Delaying additional mitigation to 2030 will substantially
increase the challenges associated with limiting warming
over the 21st century to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial
levels (high confidence). GHG emissions in 2030 lie between about
30 GtCO2-eq/yr and 50 GtCO2-eq/yr in cost-effective scenarios that are
likely to about as likely as not to limit warming to less than 2°C this cen-
tury relative to pre-industrial levels (2100 atmospheric concentration
levels of about 450 ppm CO2-eq to about 500 ppm CO2-eq) (Figure 3.3,
left panel). Scenarios with GHG emission levels of above 55 GtCO2-eq/yr
require substantially higher rates of emissions reductions between
2030 and 2050 (median estimate of 6%/yr as compared to 3%/yr in
cost-effective scenarios; Figure 3.3, middle panel); much more rapid
scale-up of zero and low-carbon energy over this period (more than a
tripling compared to a doubling of the low-carbon energy share rela-
tive to 2010; Figure 3.3, right panel); a larger reliance on CDR tech-
nologies in the long term; and higher transitional and long-term
economic impacts (Table 3.2). (3.5, 4.3) {WGIII SPM.4.1, TS.3.1, 6.4, 7.11}
Estimated global emission levels by 2020 based on the Cancún
Pledges are not consistent with cost-effective long-term mitiga-
tion trajectories that are at least about as likely as not to limit
warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels (2100
concentration levels of about 500 ppm CO2-eq or below), but
they do not preclude the option to meet this goal (high confi-
dence). The Cancún Pledges are broadly consistent with cost-effective
scenarios that are likely to limit temperature change to below 3°C rel-
ative to pre-industrial levels. {WGIII SPM.4.1, 6.4, 13.13, Figure TS.11}
Estimates of the aggregate economic costs of mitigation vary
widely depending on methodologies and assumptions but increase
with the stringency of mitigation (high confidence). Scenarios in
which all countries of the world begin mitigation immediately, in
which there is a single global carbon price, and in which all key tech-
nologies are available have been used as a cost-effective benchmark
for estimating macroeconomic mitigation costs (Figure 3.4). Under
these assumptions, mitigation scenarios that are likely to limit warm-
ing to below 2°C through the 21st century relative to pre-industrial
levels entail losses in global consumption—not including benefits of
reduced climate change (3.2) as well as co-benefits and adverse side
effects of mitigation (3.5, 4.3)—of 1 to 4% (median: 1.7%) in 2030,
2 to 6% (median: 3.4%) in 2050, and 3% to 11% (median: 4.8%) in
2100, relative to consumption in baseline scenarios that grows any-
where from 300% to more than 900% over the century4126
. These num-
bers correspond to an annualized reduction of consumption growth by
0.04 to 0.14 (median: 0.06) percentage points over the century relative
to annualized consumption growth in the baseline that is between
1.6% and 3% per year (Figure 3.4). In the absence or under limited
availability of mitigation technologies (such as bioenergy, CCS, and
their combination BECCS, nuclear, wind and solar), mitigation costs
can increase substantially depending on the technology considered
(Table 3.2). Delaying additional mitigation reduces near-term costs
but increases mitigation costs in the medium- to long-term (Table 3.2).
Many models could not limit likely warming to below 2°C over the
21st century relative to pre-industrial levels, if additional mitigation is
considerably delayed, or if availability of key technologies, such as bio-
energy, CCS and their combination (BECCS) are limited (high confidence)
(Table 3.2). {WGIII SPM.4.1, Table SPM.2, Table TS.2, TS.3.1, 6.3, 6.6}
Mitigation efforts and associated cost are expected to vary
across countries. The distribution of costs can differ from the
distribution of the actions themselves (high confidence). In glob-
ally cost-effective scenarios, the majority of mitigation efforts takes
place in countries with the highest future GHG emissions in baseline
scenarios. Some studies exploring particular effort-sharing frameworks,
under the assumption of a global carbon market, have estimated sub-
stantial global financial flows associated with mitigation in scenarios
that are likely to more unlikely than likely to limit warming during the
21st century to less than 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels. {WGIII
SPM.4.1, TS.3.1, Box 3.5, 4.6, 6.3.6, Table 6.4, Figure 6.9, Figure 6.27,

3.5 Interaction among mitigation, adaptation
and sustainable development
Climate change is a threat to equitable and sustain-
able development. Adaptation, mitigation and sus-
tainable development are closely related, with poten-
tial for synergies and trade-offs.
Climate change poses an increasing threat to equitable and
sustainable development (high confidence). Some climate-related
impacts on development are already being observed. Climate change
is a threat multiplier. It exacerbates other threats to social and natural
systems, placing additional burdens particularly on the poor and con-
straining possible development paths for all. Development along cur-
rent global pathways can contribute to climate risk and vulnerability,
further eroding the basis for sustainable development. {WGII SPM B-2,
2.5, 10.9, 13.1–13.3, 20.1, 20.2, 20.6, WGIII SPM.2, 4.2}
Aligning climate policy with sustainable development requires
attention to both adaptation and mitigation (high confidence).
Interaction among adaptation, mitigation and sustainable develop-
ment occurs both within and across regions and scales, often in the
context of multiple stressors. Some options for responding to climate
change could impose risks of other environmental and social costs,
have adverse distributional effects and draw resources away from
other development priorities, including poverty eradication. {WGII 2.5,
8.4, 9.3, 13.3–13.4, 20.2–20.4, 21.4, 25.9, 26.8, WGIII SPM.2, 4.8, 6.6}
Both adaptation and mitigation can bring substantial co-benefits
(medium confidence). Examples of actions with co-benefits include
(i) improved air quality (see Figure 3.5); (ii) enhanced energy security,
(iii) reduced energy and water consumption in urban areas through
greening cities and recycling water; (iv) sustainable agriculture and
forestry; and (v) protection of ecosystems for carbon storage and other
ecosystem services. {WGII SPM C-1, WGIII SPM.4.1}
Strategies and actions can be pursued now that will move
towards climate-resilient pathways for sustainable develop-
ment, while at the same time helping to improve livelihoods,
social and economic well-being and effective environmental
management (high confidence). Prospects for climate-resilient
pathways are related fundamentally to what the world accomplishes
with climate change mitigation (high confidence). Since mitigation
reduces the rate as well as the magnitude of warming, it also increases
the time available for adaptation to a particular level of climate
change, potentially by several decades. Delaying mitigation actions
may reduce options for climate-resilient pathways in the future. {WGII
SPM C-2, 20.2, 20.6.2}

4.1 Common enabling factors and constraints
for adaptation and mitigation responses
Adaptation and mitigation responses are underpinned
by common enabling factors. These include effective
institutions and governance, innovation and invest-
ments in environmentally sound technologies and
infrastructure, sustainable livelihoods and behavioural
and lifestyle choices.
Innovation and investments in environmentally sound infra-
structure and technologies can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions and enhance resilience to climate change (very high
confidence). Innovation and change can expand the availability and/
or effectiveness of adaptation and mitigation options. For example,
investments in low-carbon and carbon-neutral energy technologies
can reduce the energy intensity of economic development, the carbon
intensity of energy, GHG emissions, and the long-term costs of mit-
igation. Similarly, new technologies and infrastructure can increase
the resilience of human systems while reducing adverse impacts on
natural systems. Investments in technology and infrastructure rely on
an enabling policy environment, access to finance and technology
and broader economic development that builds capacity (Table 4.1,
Section 4.4). {WGII SPM C-2, Table SPM.1, Table TS.8, WGIII SPM.4.1,
Table SPM.2, TS.3.1.1, TS 3.1.2, TS.3.2.1}
Adaptation and mitigation are constrained by the inertia of
global and regional trends in economic development, GHG emis-
sions, resource consumption, infrastructure and settlement pat-
terns, institutional behaviour and technology (medium evidence,
high agreement). Such inertia may limit the capacity to reduce GHG
emissions, remain below particular climate thresholds or avoid adverse
impacts (Table 4.1). Some constraints may be overcome through new
technologies, financial resources, increased institutional effectiveness
and governance or changes in social and cultural attitudes and behav-
iours. {WGII SPM C-1, WGIII SPM.3, SPM.4.2, Table SPM.2}
Vulnerability to climate change, GHG emissions, and the capac-
ity for adaptation and mitigation are strongly influenced by
livelihoods, lifestyles, behaviour and culture (medium evidence,
medium agreement) (Table 4.1). Shifts toward more energy-intensive
lifestyles can contribute to higher energy and resource consumption,
driving greater energy production and GHG emissions and increasing
mitigation costs. In contrast, emissions can be substantially lowered
through changes in consumption patterns (see 4.3 for details). The
social acceptability and/or effectiveness of climate policies are influ-
enced by the extent to which they incentivize or depend on regionally
appropriate changes in lifestyles or behaviours. Similarly, livelihoods
that depend on climate-sensitive sectors or resources may be par-
ticularly vulnerable to climate change and climate change policies.
Economic development and urbanization of landscapes exposed to
climate hazards may increase the exposure of human settlements and
reduce the resilience of natural systems. {WGII SPM A-2, SPM B-2,

TS.2.2, 4.2}
For many regions and sectors, enhanced capacities to mitigate
and adapt are part of the foundation essential for manag-
ing climate change risks (high confidence). Such capacities are
place- and context-specific and therefore there is no single approach
for reducing risk that is appropriate across all settings. For example,
developing nations with low income levels have the lowest finan-
cial, technological and institutional capacities to pursue low-carbon,
climate-resilient development pathways. Although developed
nations generally have greater relative capacity to manage the
risks of climate change, such capacity does not necessarily trans-
late into the implementation of adaptation and mitigation options.
{WGII SPM B-1, SPM B-2, TS B-1, TS B-2, 16.3.1.1, 16.3.2, 16.5, WGIII
SPM.5.1, TS.4.3, TS.4.5, 4.6}
Improving institutions as well as enhancing coordination
and cooperation in governance can help overcome regional
constraints associated with mitigation, adaptation and disas-
ter risk reduction (very high confidence). Despite the presence
of a wide array of multilateral, national and sub-national institu-
tions focused on adaptation and mitigation, global GHG emissions
continue to increase and identified adaptation needs have not
been adequately addressed. The implementation of effective adap-
tation and mitigation options may necessitate new institutions
and institutional arrangements that span multiple scales (medium
confidence) (Table 4.1). {WGII SPM B-2, TS C-1, 16.3.2.4, 16.8,

TS.4.4}

4.2 Response options for adaptation
Adaptation options exist in all sectors, but their
context for implementation and potential to reduce
climate-related risks differs across sectors and regions.
Some adaptation responses involve significant
co-benefits, synergies and trade-offs. Increasing
climate change will increase challenges for many
adaptation options.
People, governments and the private sector are starting to adapt
to a changing climate. Since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report
(AR4), understanding of response options has increased, with
improved knowledge of their benefits, costs and links to sus-
tainable development. Adaptation can take a variety of approaches
depending on its context in vulnerability reduction, disaster risk man-
agement or proactive adaptation planning. These include (see Table 4.2
for examples and details):
• Social, ecological asset and infrastructure development
• Technological process optimization
• Integrated natural resources management
• Institutional, educational and behavioural change or reinforcement
• Financial services, including risk transfer
• Information systems to support early warning and proactive planning
There is increasing recognition of the value of social (including local and
indigenous), institutional, and ecosystem-based measures and of the extent
of constraints to adaptation. Effective strategies and actions consider the
potential for co-benefits and opportunities within wider strategic goals
and development plans. {WGII SPM A-2, SPM C-1, TS A-2, 6.4, 8.3, 9.4, 15.3}
Opportunities to enable adaptation planning and implementation
exist in all sectors and regions, with diverse potential and approaches
depending on context. The need for adaptation along with asso-
ciated challenges is expected to increase with climate change
(very high confidence). Examples of key adaptation approaches
for particular sectors, including constraints and limits, are summarized
below. {WGII SPM B, SPM C, 16.4, 16.6, 17.2, 19.6, 19.7, Table 16.3}
Freshwater resources
Adaptive water management techniques, including scenario
planning, learning-based approaches and flexible and low-regret
solutions, can help adjust to uncertain hydrological changes
due to climate change and their impacts (limited evidence,
high agreement). Strategies include adopting integrated water man-
agement, augmenting supply, reducing the mismatch between water
supply and demand, reducing non-climate stressors, strengthening
institutional capacities and adopting more water-efficient technologies
and water-saving strategies. {WGII SPM B-2, Assessment Box SPM.2
Table 1, SPM B-3, 3.6, 22.3–22.4, 23.4, 23.7, 24.4, 27.2–27.3, Box 25-2}
Terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems
Management actions can reduce but not eliminate risks of
impacts to terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems due to climate
change (high confidence). Actions include maintenance of genetic
diversity, assisted species migration and dispersal, manipulation
of disturbance regimes (e.g., fires, floods) and reduction of other
stressors. Management options that reduce non-climatic stressors,
such as habitat modification, overexploitation, pollution and invasive
species, increase the inherent capacity of ecosystems and their species
to adapt to a changing climate. Other options include improving early
warning systems and associated response systems. Enhanced connec-
tivity of vulnerable ecosystems may also assist autonomous adapta-
tion. Translocation of species is controversial and is expected to become
less feasible where whole ecosystems are at risk. {WGII SPM B-2,
SPM B-3, Figure SPM.5, Table TS.8, 4.4, 25.6, 26.4, Box CC-RF}
Coastal systems and low-lying areas
Increasingly, coastal adaptation options include those based on
integrated coastal zone management, local community partici-
pation, ecosystems-based approaches and disaster risk reduc-
tion, mainstreamed into relevant strategies and management
plans (high confidence). The analysis and implementation of coastal
adaptation has progressed more significantly in developed countries
than in developing countries (high confidence). The relative costs of
coastal adaptation are expected to vary strongly among and within
regions and countries. {WGII SPM B-2, SPM B-3, 5.5, 8.3, 22.3, 24.4,
26.8, Box 25-1}
Marine systems and oceans
Marine forecasting and early warning systems as well as reduc-
ing non-climatic stressors have the potential to reduce risks for
some fisheries and aquaculture industries, but options for unique
ecosystems such as coral reefs are limited (high confidence).
Fisheries and some aquaculture industries with high-technology
and/or large investments have high capacities for adaptation due to
greater development of environmental monitoring, modelling and
resource assessments. Adaptation options include large-scale translo-
cation of industrial fishing activities and flexible management that can
react to variability and change. For smaller-scale fisheries and nations
with limited adaptive capacities, building social resilience, alternative
livelihoods and occupational flexibility are important strategies. Adap-
tation options for coral reef systems are generally limited to reduc-
ing other stressors, mainly by enhancing water quality and limiting
pressures from tourism and fishing, but their efficacy will be severely
reduced as thermal stress and ocean acidification increase. {WGII
SPM B-2, SPM Assessment Box SPM.2 Table 1, TS B-2, 5.5, 6.4, 7.5,
25.6.2, 29.4, 30.6-7, Box CC-MB, Box CC-CR}
Food production system/Rural areas
Adaptation options for agriculture include technological
responses, enhancing smallholder access to credit and other
critical production resources, strengthening institutions at local
to regional levels and improving market access through trade
reform (medium confidence). Responses to decreased food pro-
duction and quality include: developing new crop varieties adapted to
changes in CO2, temperature, and drought; enhancing the capacity for
climate risk management; and offsetting economic impacts of land use
change. Improving financial support and investing in the production of
small-scale farms can also provide benefits. Expanding agricultural mar-
kets and improving the predictability and reliability of the world trad-
ing system could result in reduced market volatility and help manage
food supply shortages caused by climate change. {WGII SPM B-2,
SPM B-3, 7.5, 9.3, 22.4, 22.6, 25.9, 27.3}
Urban areas/Key economic sectors and services
Urban adaptation benefits from effective multi-level govern-
ance, alignment of policies and incentives, strengthened local
government and community adaptation capacity, synergies
with the private sector and appropriate financing and institu-
tional development (medium confidence). Enhancing the capacity
of low-income groups and vulnerable communities and their partner-
ships with local governments can also be an effective urban climate
adaptation strategy. Examples of adaptation mechanisms include
large-scale public-private risk reduction initiatives and economic diver-
sification and government insurance for the non-diversifiable portion
of risk. In some locations, especially at the upper end of projected cli-
mate changes, responses could also require transformational changes
such as managed retreat. {WGII SPM B-2, 8.3–8.4, 24.4, 24.5, 26.8,
Box 25-9}
Human health, security and livelihoods
Adaptation options that focus on strengthening existing deliv-
ery systems and institutions, as well as insurance and social pro-
tection strategies, can improve health, security and livelihoods
in the near term (high confidence). The most effective vulnerability
reduction measures for health in the near term are programmes that
implement and improve basic public health measures such as provision
of clean water and sanitation, secure essential health care including
vaccination and child health services, increase capacity for disaster pre-
paredness and response and alleviate poverty (very high confidence).
Options to address heat related mortality include health warning sys-
tems linked to response strategies, urban planning and improvements
to the built environment to reduce heat stress. Robust institutions
can manage many transboundary impacts of climate change to reduce
risk of conflicts over shared natural resources. Insurance programmes,
social protection measures and disaster risk management may enhance
long-term livelihood resilience among the poor and marginalized
people, if policies address multi-dimensional poverty. {WGII SPM
B-2, SPM B-3, 8.2, 10.8, 11.7–11.8, 12.5–12.6, 22.3, 23.9, 25.8, 26.6,
Box CC-HS}
Significant co-benefits, synergies and trade-offs exist between
adaptation and mitigation and among different adaptation
responses; interactions occur both within and across regions
and sectors (very high confidence). For example, investments in
crop varieties adapted to climate change can increase the capacity
to cope with drought, and public health measures to address
vector-borne diseases can enhance the capacity of health sys-
tems to address other challenges. Similarly, locating infrastructure
away from low-lying coastal areas helps settlements and eco-
systems adapt to sea level rise while also protecting against
tsunamis. However, some adaptation options may have adverse
side effects that imply real or perceived trade-offs with other
adaptation objectives (see Table 4.3 for examples), mitigation
objectives or broader development goals. For example, while pro-
tection of ecosystems can assist adaptation to climate change
and enhance carbon storage, increased use of air conditioning to
maintain thermal comfort in buildings or the use of desalination
to enhance water resource security can increase energy demand,
and therefore, GHG emissions. {WGII SPM B-2, SPM C-1, 5.4.2,
16.3.2.9, 17.2.3.1, Table 16-2}

4.3 Response options for mitigation
Mitigation options are available in every major sector.
Mitigation can be more cost-effective if using an
integrated approach that combines measures to reduce
energy use and the greenhouse gas intensity of end-use
sectors, decarbonize energy supply, reduce net emis-
sions and enhance carbon sinks in land-based sectors.
A broad range of sectoral mitigation options is available that
can reduce GHG emission intensity, improve energy intensity
through enhancements of technology, behaviour, production and
resource efficiency and enable structural changes or changes
in activity. In addition, direct options in agriculture, forestry and
other land use (AFOLU) involve reducing CO2 emissions by reducing
deforestation, forest degradation and forest fires; storing carbon in
terrestrial systems (for example, through afforestation); and provid-
ing bioenergy feedstocks. Options to reduce non-CO2 emissions exist
across all sectors but most notably in agriculture, energy supply and
industry. An overview of sectoral mitigation options and potentials is
provided in Table 4.4. {WGIII TS 3.2.1}
Well-designed systemic and cross-sectoral mitigation strate-
gies are more cost-effective in cutting emissions than a focus
on individual technologies and sectors with efforts in one
sector affecting the need for mitigation in others (medium
confidence). In baseline scenarios without new mitigation policies,
GHG emissions are projected to grow in all sectors, except for net CO2
emissions in the AFOLU sector (Figure 4.1, left panel). Mitigation sce-
narios reaching around 450 ppm CO2-eq4227 concentration by 21004328
(likely to limit warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels) show large-
scale global changes in the energy supply sector (Figure 4.1, middle
and right panel). While rapid decarbonization of energy supply gen-
erally entails more flexibility for end-use and AFOLU sectors, stronger
demand reductions lessen the mitigation challenge for the supply side
of the energy system (Figures 4.1 and 4.2). There are thus strong inter-
dependencies across sectors and the resulting distribution of the miti-
gation effort is strongly influenced by the availability and performance
of future technologies, particularly BECCS and large scale afforestation
(Figure 4.1, middle and right panel). The next two decades present a
window of opportunity for mitigation in urban areas, as a large portion
of the world’s urban areas will be developed during this period. {WGIII
SPM.4.2, TS.3.2}
Decarbonizing (i.e., reducing the carbon intensity of) electricity
generation is a key component of cost-effective mitigation
strategies in achieving low stabilization levels (of about 450
to about 500 ppm CO2-eq, at least about as likely as not to
limit warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels) (medium evi-
dence, high agreement). In most integrated modelling scenarios,
decarbonization happens more rapidly in electricity generation than in
the industry, buildings and transport sectors. In scenarios reaching
450 ppm CO2-eq concentrations by 2100, global CO2 emissions from
the energy supply sector are projected to decline over the next decade
and are characterized by reductions of 90% or more below 2010 levels
between 2040 and 2070. {WGIII SPM.4.2, 6.8, 7.11}
Efficiency enhancements and behavioural changes, in order to
reduce energy demand compared to baseline scenarios without
compromising development, are a key mitigation strategy in
scenarios reaching atmospheric CO2-eq concentrations of about
450 to about 500 ppm by 2100 (robust evidence, high agree-
ment). Near-term reductions in energy demand are an important
element of cost-effective mitigation strategies, provide more flexibility
for reducing carbon intensity in the energy supply sector, hedge against
related supply-side risks, avoid lock-in to carbon-intensive infra-
structures and are associated with important co-benefits (Figure 4.2,
Table 4.4). Emissions can be substantially lowered through changes in
consumption patterns (e.g., mobility demand and mode, energy use in
households, choice of longer-lasting products) and dietary change and
reduction in food wastes. A number of options including monetary and
non-monetary incentives as well as information measures may facili-
tate behavioural changes. {WGIII SPM.4.2}
Decarbonization of the energy supply sector (i.e., reducing the
carbon intensity) requires upscaling of low- and zero-carbon
electricity generation technologies (high confidence). In the
majority of low-concentration stabilization scenarios (about 450 to
about 500 ppm CO2-eq , at least about as likely as not to limit warming
to 2°C above pre-industrial levels), the share of low-carbon electricity
supply (comprising renewable energy (RE), nuclear and CCS, includ-
ing BECCS) increases from the current share of approximately 30%
to more than 80% by 2050 and 90% by 2100, and fossil fuel power
generation without CCS is phased out almost entirely by 2100. Among
these low-carbon technologies, a growing number of RE technologies
have achieved a level of maturity to enable deployment at significant
scale since AR4 (robust evidence, high agreement) and nuclear energy
is a mature low-GHG emission source of baseload power, but its share
of global electricity generation has been declining (since 1993). GHG
emissions from energy supply can be reduced significantly by replacing
current world average coal-fired power plants with modern, highly effi-
cient natural gas combined-cycle power plants or combined heat and
power plants, provided that natural gas is available and the fugitive
emissions associated with extraction and supply are low or mitigated.
{WGIII SPM.4.2}
Behaviour, lifestyle and culture have a considerable influence
on energy use and associated emissions, with high mitigation
potential in some sectors, in particular when complementing
technological and structural change (medium evidence, medium
agreement). In the transport sector, technical and behavioural mitiga-
tion measures for all modes, plus new infrastructure and urban rede-
velopment investments, could reduce final energy demand significantly
below baseline levels (robust evidence, medium agreement) (Table 4.4).
While opportunities for switching to low-carbon fuels exist, the rate
of decarbonization in the transport sector might be constrained by
challenges associated with energy storage and the relatively low
energy density of low-carbon transport fuels (medium confidence). In
the building sector, recent advances in technologies, know-how and
policies provide opportunities to stabilize or reduce global energy use
to about current levels by mid-century. In addition, recent improve-
ments in performance and costs make very low energy construction
and retrofits of buildings economically attractive, sometimes even at
net negative costs (robust evidence, high agreement). In the industry
sector, improvements in GHG emission efficiency and in the efficiency
of material use, recycling and reuse of materials and products, and
overall reductions in product demand (e.g., through a more intensive
use of products) and service demand could, in addition to energy effi-
ciency, help reduce GHG emissions below the baseline level. Prevalent
approaches for promoting energy efficiency in industry include infor-
mation programmes followed by economic instruments, regulatory
approaches and voluntary actions. Important options for mitigation
in waste management are waste reduction, followed by re-use, recy-
cling and energy recovery (robust evidence, high agreement). {WGIII
SPM.4.2, Box TS.12, TS.3.2}
The most cost-effective mitigation options in forestry are
afforestation, sustainable forest management and reducing
deforestation, with large differences in their relative impor-
tance across regions. In agriculture, the most cost-effective mit-
igation options are cropland management, grazing land man-
agement and restoration of organic soils (medium evidence,
high agreement). About a third of mitigation potential in forestry
can be achieved at a cost <20 USD/tCO2-eq emission. Demand-side
measures, such as changes in diet and reductions of losses in the food
supply chain, have a significant, but uncertain, potential to reduce
GHG emissions from food production (medium evidence, medium
agreement). {WGIII SPM 4.2.4}
Bioenergy can play a critical role for mitigation, but there are
issues to consider, such as the sustainability of practices and
the efficiency of bioenergy systems (robust evidence, medium
agreement). Evidence suggests that bioenergy options with low life-
cycle emissions, some already available, can reduce GHG emissions;
outcomes are site-specific and rely on efficient integrated ‘biomass-
to-bioenergy systems’, and sustainable land use management and
governance. Barriers to large-scale deployment of bioenergy include
concerns about GHG emissions from land, food security, water resources,
biodiversity conservation and livelihoods. {WGIII SPM.4.2}
Mitigation measures intersect with other societal goals, cre-
ating the possibility of co-benefits or adverse side-effects.
These intersections, if well-managed, can strengthen the basis
for undertaking climate mitigation actions (robust evidence,
medium agreement). Mitigation can positively or negatively influ-
ence the achievement of other societal goals, such as those related to
human health, food security, biodiversity, local environmental quality,
energy access, livelihoods and equitable sustainable development (see
also Section 4.5). On the other hand, policies towards other societal
goals can influence the achievement of mitigation and adaptation
objectives. These influences can be substantial, although sometimes
difficult to quantify, especially in welfare terms. This multi-objective
perspective is important in part because it helps to identify areas
where support for policies that advance multiple goals will be robust.
Potential co-benefits and adverse side effects of the main sectoral
mitigation measures are summarized in Table 4.5. Overall, the potential
for co-benefits for energy end-use measures outweigh the potential
for adverse side effects, whereas the evidence suggests this may not
be the case for all energy supply and AFOLU measures. {WGIII SPM.2}

4.4.1 International and regional cooperation
on adaptation and mitigation
Because climate change has the characteristics of a collective action
problem at the global scale (see 3.1), effective mitigation will not be
achieved if individual agents advance their own interests independently,
even though mitigation can also have local co-benefits. Cooperative
responses, including international cooperation, are therefore required
to effectively mitigate GHG emissions and address other climate
change issues. While adaptation focuses primarily on local to national
scale outcomes, its effectiveness can be enhanced through coordina-
tion across governance scales, including international cooperation. In
fact, international cooperation has helped to facilitate the creation
of adaptation strategies, plans, and actions at national, sub-national,
and local levels. A variety of climate policy instruments have been
employed, and even more could be employed, at international and
regional levels to address mitigation and to support and promote
adaptation at national and sub-national scales. Evidence suggests that
outcomes seen as equitable can lead to more effective cooperation.
{WGII SPM C-1, 2.2, 15.2, WGIII 13.ES, 14.3, 15.8, SREX SPM, 7.ES}
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) is the main multilateral forum focused on address-
ing climate change, with nearly universal participation. UNFCCC
activities since 2007, which include the 2010 Cancún Agreements
and the 2011 Durban Platform for Enhanced Action, have sought to
enhance actions under the Convention, and have led to an increas-
ing number of institutions and other arrangements for international
climate change cooperation. Other institutions organized at different
levels of governance have resulted in diversifying international climate
change cooperation. {WGIII SPM.5.2, 13.5}
Existing and proposed international climate change coopera-
tion arrangements vary in their focus and degree of centrali-
zation and coordination. They span: multilateral agreements, har-
monized national policies and decentralized but coordinated national
policies, as well as regional and regionally-coordinated policies (see
Figure 4.3). {WGIII SPM.5.2}
While a number of new institutions are focused on adaptation
funding and coordination, adaptation has historically received
less attention than mitigation in international climate policy
(robust evidence, medium agreement). Inclusion of adaptation is
increasingly important to reduce the risk from climate change impacts
and may engage a greater number of countries. {WGIII 13.2, 13.3.3,
13.5.1.1, 13.14}
The Kyoto Protocol offers lessons towards achieving the ulti-
mate objective of the UNFCCC, particularly with respect to par-
ticipation, implementation, flexibility mechanisms, and environ-
mental effectiveness (medium evidence, low agreement). The
Protocol was the first binding step toward implementing the princi-
ples and goals provided by the UNFCCC. According to national GHG
inventories through 2012 submitted to the UNFCCC by October 2013,
Annex B Parties with quantified emission limitations (and reduction
obligations) in aggregate may have bettered their collective emission
reduction target in the first commitment period,4429
but some emissions
reductions that would have occurred even in its absence were also
counted. The Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) created
a market for emissions offsets from developing countries, the purpose
being two-fold: to help Annex I countries fulfill their commitments and
to assist non-Annex I countries achieve sustainable development. The
CDM generated Certified Emission Reductions (offsets) equivalent to
emissions of over 1.4 GtCO2-eq4242by October 2013, led to significant
project investments, and generated investment flows for a variety of
functions, including the UNFCCC Adaptation Fund. However, its envi-
ronmental effectiveness has been questioned by some, particularly
in regard to its early years, due to concerns about the additionality
of projects (that is, whether projects bring about emissions that are
different from business as usual (BAU) circumstances), the validity of
baselines, and the possibility of emissions leakage (medium evidence,
medium agreement). Such concerns about additionality are common
to any emission-reduction-credit (offset) program, and are not specific
to the CDM. Due to market forces, the majority of single CDM projects
have been concentrated in a limited number of countries, while Pro-
grammes of Activities, though less frequent, have been more evenly
distributed. In addition, the Kyoto Protocol created two other ‘flexibility
mechanisms’: Joint Implementation and International Emissions Trad-
ing. {WGIII SPM.5.2, Table TS.9, 13.7, 13.13.1.1, 14.3}
Several conceptual models for effort-sharing have been iden-
tified in research. However, realized distributional impacts from
actual international cooperative agreements depend not only on the
approach taken but also on criteria applied to operationalize equity
and the manner in which developing countries’ emissions reduction
plans are financed. {WGIII 4.6, 13.4}
Policy linkages among regional, national and sub-national cli-
mate policies offer potential climate change mitigation ben-
efits (medium evidence, medium agreement). Linkages have
been established between carbon markets and in principle could also
be established between and among a heterogeneous set of policy
instruments including non-market-based policies, such as perfor-
mance standards. Potential advantages include lower mitigation costs,
decreased emission leakage and increased market liquidity. {WGIII
SPM.5.2, 13.3, 13.5, 13.6, 13.7, 14.5}
Regional initiatives between national and global scales are
being developed and implemented, but their impact on global
mitigation has been limited to date (medium confidence). Some
climate policies could be more environmentally and economically
effective if implemented across broad regions, such as by embodying
mitigation objectives in trade agreements or jointly constructing infra-
structures that facilitate reduction in carbon emissions. {WGIII
Table TS.9, 13.13, 14.4, 14.5}
International cooperation for supporting adaptation planning
and implementation has assisted in the creation of adaptation
strategies, plans and actions at national, sub-national and local
levels (high confidence). For example, a range of multilateral and
regionally targeted funding mechanisms have been established for
adaptation; UN agencies, international development organizations and
non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have provided information,
methodologies and guidelines; and global and regional initiatives sup-
ported and promoted the creation of national adaptation strategies in
both developing and developed countries. Closer integration of disas-
ter risk reduction and climate change adaptation at the international
level, and the mainstreaming of both into international development
assistance, may foster greater efficiency in the use of resources and
capacity. However, stronger efforts at the international level do not
necessarily lead to substantive and rapid results at the local level.
{WGII 15.2, 15.3, SREX SPM, 7.4, 8.2, 8.5}

4.4.2.1 Adaptation
Adaptation experience is accumulating across regions in the
public and private sector and within communities (high confi-
dence). Adaptation options adopted to date (see Table 4.6) emphasize
incremental adjustments and co-benefits and are starting to emphasize
flexibility and learning (medium evidence, medium agreement). Most
assessments of adaptation have been restricted to impacts, vulnerabil-
ity and adaptation planning, with very few assessing the processes of
implementation or the effects of adaptation actions (medium evidence,
high agreement). {WGII SPM A-2, TS A-2}
National governments play key roles in adaptation planning
and implementation (robust evidence, high agreement). There
has been substantial progress since the AR4 in the development of
national adaptation strategies and plans. This includes National Adap-
tation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) by least developed countries, the
National Adaptation Plan (NAP) process, and strategic frameworks for
national adaptation in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) countries. National governments can coordinate
adaptation efforts of local and sub-national governments, for example
by protecting vulnerable groups, by supporting economic diversifica-
tion, and by providing information, policy and legal frameworks and
financial support. {WGII SPM C-1, 15.2}
While local government and the private sector have different
functions, which vary regionally, they are increasingly recog-
nized as critical to progress in adaptation, given their roles in
scaling up adaptation of communities, households and civil soci-
ety and in managing risk information and financing (medium
evidence, high agreement). There is a significant increase in the
number of planned adaptation responses at the local level in rural and
urban communities of developed and developing countries since the
AR4. However, local councils and planners are often confronted by the
complexity of adaptation without adequate access to guiding infor-
mation or data on local vulnerabilities and potential impacts. Steps for
mainstreaming adaptation into local decision-making have been iden-
tified but challenges remain in their implementation. Hence, scholars
stress the important role of linkages with national and sub-national
levels of government as well as partnerships among public, civic and
private sectors in implementing local adaptation responses. {WGII
SPM A-2, SPM C-1, 14.2, 15.2}
Institutional dimensions of adaptation governance, including the
integration of adaptation into planning and decision-making,
play a key role in promoting the transition from planning to
implementation of adaptation (robust evidence, high agree-
ment). The most commonly emphasized institutional barriers or ena-
blers for adaptation planning and implementation are: 1) multilevel
institutional co-ordination between different political and administra-
tive levels in society; 2) key actors, advocates and champions initiating,
mainstreaming and sustaining momentum for climate adaptation; 3)
horizontal interplay between sectors, actors and policies operating at
similar administrative levels; 4) political dimensions in planning and
implementation; and 5) coordination between formal governmen-
tal, administrative agencies and private sectors and stakeholders to
increase efficiency, representation and support for climate adaptation
measures. {WGII 15.2, 15.5, 16.3, Box 15-1}
Existing and emerging economic instruments can foster adap-
tation by providing incentives for anticipating and reducing
impacts (medium confidence). Instruments include public-private
finance partnerships, loans, payments for environmental services,
improved resource pricing, charges and subsidies, norms and regula-
tions and risk sharing and transfer mechanisms. Risk financing mecha-
nisms in the public and private sector, such as insurance and risk pools,
can contribute to increasing resilience, but without attention to major
design challenges, they can also provide disincentives, cause market
failure and decrease equity. Governments often play key roles as regu-
lators, providers or insurers of last resort. {WGII SPM C-1}

4.4.2.2 Mitigation
There has been a considerable increase in national and sub-
national mitigation plans and strategies since AR4. In 2012, 67%
of global GHG emissions42 were subject to national legislation or strat-
egies versus 45% in 2007. However, there has not yet been a substan-
tial deviation in global emissions from the past trend. These plans and
strategies are in their early stages of development and implementation
in many countries, making it difficult to assess their aggregate impact
on future global emissions (medium evidence, high agreement). {WGIII
SPM.5.1}
Since AR4, there has been an increased focus on policies
designed to integrate multiple objectives, increase co-benefits
and reduce adverse side effects (high confidence). Governments
often explicitly reference co-benefits in climate and sectoral plans and
strategies. {WGIII SPM.5.1}
Sector-specific policies have been more widely used than econ-
omy-wide policies (Table 4.7) (medium evidence, high agree-
ment). Although most economic theory suggests that economy-wide
policies for mitigation would be more cost-effective than sector-specific
policies, administrative and political barriers may make economy-wide
policies harder to design and implement than sector-specific policies.
The latter may be better suited to address barriers or market failures
specific to certain sectors and may be bundled in packages of comple-
mentary policies {WGIII SPM.5.1}
In principle, mechanisms that set a carbon price, including cap
and trade systems and carbon taxes, can achieve mitigation in
a cost-effective way, but have been implemented with diverse
effects due in part to national circumstances as well as policy
design. The short-run environmental effects of cap and trade sys-
tems have been limited as a result of loose caps or caps that have not
proved to be constraining (limited evidence, medium agreement). In
some countries, tax-based policies specifically aimed at reducing GHG
emissions—alongside technology and other policies—have helped to
weaken the link between GHG emissions and gross domestic product
(GDP) (high confidence). In addition, in a large group of countries, fuel
taxes (although not necessarily designed for the purpose of mitigation)
have had effects that are akin to sectoral carbon taxes (robust evi-
dence, medium agreement). Revenues from carbon taxes or auctioned
emission allowances are used in some countries to reduce other taxes
and/or to provide transfers to low-income groups. This illustrates the
general principle that mitigation policies that raise government reve-
nue generally have lower social costs than approaches which do not.
{WGIII SPM.5.1}
Economic instruments in the form of subsidies may be applied
across sectors, and include a variety of policy designs, such as tax
rebates or exemptions, grants, loans and credit lines. An increas-
ing number and variety of RE policies including subsidies—motivated
by many factors—have driven escalated growth of RE technologies in
recent years. Government policies play a crucial role in accelerating the
deployment of RE technologies. Energy access and social and economic
development have been the primary drivers in most developing coun-
tries whereas secure energy supply and environmental concerns have
been most important in developed countries. The focus of policies is
broadening from a concentration primarily on RE electricity to include
RE heating and cooling and transportation. {SRREN SPM.7}
The reduction of subsidies for GHG-related activities in vari-
ous sectors can achieve emission reductions, depending on the
social and economic context (high confidence). While subsidies
can affect emissions in many sectors, most of the recent literature has
focused on subsidies for fossil fuels. Since AR4 a small but growing
literature based on economy-wide models has projected that com-
plete removal of subsidies to fossil fuels in all countries could result
in reductions in global aggregate emissions by mid-century (medium
evidence, medium agreement). Studies vary in methodology, the type
and definition of subsidies and the time frame for phase out consid-
ered. In particular, the studies assess the impacts of complete removal
of all fossil fuel subsides without seeking to assess which subsidies
are wasteful and inefficient, keeping in mind national circumstances.
{WGIII SPM.5.1}
Regulatory approaches and information measures are widely
used and are often environmentally effective (medium evi-
dence, medium agreement). Examples of regulatory approaches
include energy efficiency standards; examples of information pro-
grammes include labelling programmes that can help consumers make
better-informed decisions. {WGIII SPM.5.1}
Mitigation policy could devalue fossil fuel assets and reduce rev-
enues for fossil fuel exporters, but differences between regions
and fuels exist (high confidence). Most mitigation scenarios are
associated with reduced revenues from coal and oil trade for major
exporters. The effect on natural gas export revenues is more uncertain.
The availability of CCS would reduce the adverse effect of mitigation
on the value of fossil fuel assets (medium confidence). {WGIII SPM.5.1}
Interactions between or among mitigation policies may be syn-
ergistic or may have no additive effect on reducing emissions
(medium evidence, high agreement). For instance, a carbon tax can
have an additive environmental effect to policies such as subsidies for
the supply of RE. By contrast, if a cap and trade system has a sufficiently
stringent cap to affect emission-related decisions, then other policies
have no further impact on reducing emissions (although they may
affect costs and possibly the viability of more stringent future targets)
(medium evidence, high agreement). In either case, additional policies
may be needed to address market failures relating to innovation and
technology diffusion. {WGIII SPM.5.1}
Sub-national climate policies are increasingly prevalent, both
in countries with national policies and in those without. These
policies include state and provincial climate plans combining market,
regulatory and information instruments, and sub-national cap-and-trade
systems. In addition, transnational cooperation has arisen among
sub-national actors, notably among institutional investors, NGOs
seeking to govern carbon offset markets, and networks of cities seek-
ing to collaborate in generating low-carbon urban development.
{WGIII 13.5.2, 15.2.4, 15.8}
Co-benefits and adverse side effects of mitigation could affect
achievement of other objectives such as those related to human
health, food security, biodiversity, local environmental quality,
energy access, livelihoods and equitable sustainable develop-
ment: {WGIII SPM.2}
• Mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 or 500 ppm CO2-equivalent
by 2100 show reduced costs for achieving air quality and energy
security objectives, with significant co-benefits for human health,
ecosystem impacts and sufficiency of resources and resilience of
the energy system. {WGIII SPM.4.1}
• Some mitigation policies raise the prices for some energy ser-
vices and could hamper the ability of societies to expand access
to modern energy services to underserved populations (low con-
fidence). These potential adverse side effects can be avoided with
the adoption of complementary policies such as income tax rebates
or other benefit transfer mechanisms (medium confidence). The
costs of achieving nearly universal access to electricity and clean
fuels for cooking and heating are projected to be between USD 72
to 95 billion per year until 2030 with minimal effects on GHG emis-
sions (limited evidence, medium agreement) and multiple benefits
in health and air pollutant reduction (high confidence). {WGIII
SPM.5.1}
Whether or not side effects materialize, and to what extent side effects
materialize, will be case- and site-specific, and depend on local cir-
cumstances and the scale, scope and pace of implementation. Many
co-benefits and adverse side effects have not been well-quantified.
{WGIII SPM.4.1}

4.4.3 Technology development and transfer
Technology policy (development, diffusion and transfer) com-
plements other mitigation policies across all scales from inter-
national to sub-national, but worldwide investment in research
in support of GHG mitigation is small relative to overall public
research spending (high confidence). Technology policy includes
technology-push (e.g., publicly-funded R&D) and demand-pull (e.g.,
governmental procurement programmes). Such policies address
a pervasive market failure because, in the absence of government
policy such as patent protection, the invention of new technologies
and practices from R&D efforts has aspects of a public good and
thus tends to be under-provided by market forces alone. Technology
support policies have promoted substantial innovation and diffusion
of new technologies, but the cost-effectiveness of such policies is
often difficult to assess. Technology policy can increase incentives for
participation and compliance with international cooperative efforts,
particularly in the long run. {WGIII SPM.5.1, 2.6.5, 3.11, 13.9, 13.12,
15.6.5}
Many adaptation efforts also critically rely on diffusion and
transfer of technologies and management practices, but their
effective use depends on a suitable institutional, regulatory,
social and cultural context (high confidence). Adaptation tech-
nologies are often familiar and already applied elsewhere. However,
the success of technology transfer may involve not only the provision
of finance and information, but also strengthening of policy and reg-
ulatory environments and capacities to absorb, employ and improve
technologies appropriate to local circumstances. {WGII 15.4}

4.4.4 Investment and finance
Substantial reductions in emissions would require large changes
in investment patterns (high confidence). Mitigation scenarios
in which policies stabilize atmospheric concentrations (without over-
shoot) in the range from 430 to 530 ppm CO2-eq by 21004530 lead to sub-
stantial shifts in annual investment flows during the period 2010–2029
compared to baseline scenarios. Over the next two decades (2010–
2029), annual investments in conventional fossil fuel technologies
associated with the electricity supply sector are projected to decline in
the scenarios by about USD 30 (2 to 166) billion (median: –20% com-
pared to 2010) while annual investment in low carbon electricity supply
(i.e., renewables, nuclear and electricity with CCS) is projected to rise
in the scenarios by about USD 147 (31 to 360) billion (median: +100%
compared to 2010) (limited evidence, medium agreement). In addition,
annual incremental energy efficiency investments in transport, industry
and buildings is projected to rise in the scenarios by about USD 336
(1 to 641) billion. Global total annual investment in the energy system
is presently about USD 1,200 billion. This number includes only energy
supply of electricity and heat and respective upstream and downstream
activities. Energy efficiency investment or underlying sector investment
is not included (Figure 4.4). {WGIII SPM.5.1, 16.2}
There is no widely agreed definition of what constitutes climate
finance, but estimates of the financial flows associated with
climate change mitigation and adaptation are available. See
Figure 4.5 for an overview of climate finance flows. Published assess-
ments of all current annual financial flows whose expected effect is
to reduce net GHG emissions and/or to enhance resilience to climate
change and climate variability show USD 343 to 385 billion per year
globally (medium confidence). Out of this, total public climate finance
that flowed to developing countries is estimated to be between USD 35
and 49 billion per year in 2011 and 2012 (medium confidence). Esti-
mates of international private climate finance flowing to developing
countries range from USD 10 to 72 billion per year including foreign
direct investment as equity and loans in the range of USD 10 to 37 billion
per year over the period of 2008–2011 (medium confidence). {WGIII
SPM.5.1}
In many countries, the private sector plays central roles in the
processes that lead to emissions as well as to mitigation and
adaptation. Within appropriate enabling environments, the pri-
vate sector, along with the public sector, can play an impor-
tant role in financing mitigation and adaptation (medium evi-
dence, high agreement). The share of total mitigation finance from
the private sector, acknowledging data limitations, is estimated to be
on average between two-thirds and three-fourths on the global level
(2010–2012) (limited evidence, medium agreement). In many coun-
tries, public finance interventions by governments and international
development banks encourage climate investments by the private
sector and provide finance where private sector investment is limited.
The quality of a country’s enabling environment includes the effective-
ness of its institutions, regulations and guidelines regarding the pri-
vate sector, security of property rights, credibility of policies and other
factors that have a substantial impact on whether private firms invest
in new technologies and infrastructures. Dedicated policy instruments
and financial arrangements, for example, credit insurance, feed-in tar-
iffs, concessional finance or rebates provide an incentive for mitigation
investment by improving the return adjusted for the risk for private
actors. Public-private risk reduction initiatives (such as in the context
of insurance systems) and economic diversification are examples of
adaptation action enabling and relying on private sector participation.
{WGII SPM B-2, SPM C-1, WGIII SPM.5.1}
Financial resources for adaptation have become available
more slowly than for mitigation in both developed and devel-
oping countries. Limited evidence indicates that there is a gap
between global adaptation needs and the funds available for
adaptation (medium confidence). Potential synergies between
international finance for disaster risk management and adaptation
to climate change have not yet been fully realized (high confidence).
There is a need for better assessment of global adaptation costs, fund-
ing and investment. Studies estimating the global cost of adaptation
are characterized by shortcomings in data, methods and coverage
(high confidence). {WGII SPM C-1, 14.2, SREX SPM}

4.5 Trade-offs, synergies and integrated responses
There are many opportunities to link mitigation, adap-
tation and the pursuit of other societal objectives
through integrated responses (high confidence). Suc-
cessful implementation relies on relevant tools, suit-
able governance structures and enhanced capacity to
respond (medium confidence).
A growing evidence base indicates close links between adaptation and
mitigation, their co-benefits and adverse side effects, and recognizes
sustainable development as the overarching context for climate policy
(see Sections 3.5, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3). Developing tools to address these
linkages is critical to the success of climate policy in the context of
sustainable development (see also Sections 4.4 and 3.5). This section
presents examples of integrated responses in specific policy arenas, as
well as some of the factors that promote or impede policies aimed at
multiple objectives.
Increasing efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change
imply an increasing complexity of interactions, encompassing
connections among human health, water, energy, land use and
biodiversity (very high confidence). Mitigation can support the
achievement of other societal goals, such as those related to human
health, food security, environmental quality, energy access, livelihoods
and sustainable development, although there can also be negative
effects. Adaptation measures also have the potential to deliver miti-
gation co-benefits, and vice versa, and support other societal goals,
though trade-offs can also arise. {WGII SPM C-1, SPM C-2, 8.4, 9.3–9.4,
11.9, Box CC-WE, WGIII Table TS.3, Table TS.4, Table TS.5, Table TS.6,
Table TS.7}
Integration of adaptation and mitigation into planning and
decision-making can create synergies with sustainable develop-
ment (high confidence). Synergies and trade-offs among mitigation
and adaptation policies and policies advancing other societal goals
can be substantial, although sometimes difficult to quantify especially
in welfare terms (see also Section 3.5). A multi-objective approach to
policy-making can help manage these synergies and trade-offs. Poli-
cies advancing multiple goals may also attract greater support. {WGII
SPM C-1, SPM C-2, 20.3, WGIII 1.2.1, 3.6.3, 4.3, 4.6, 4.8, 6.6.1}
Effective integrated responses depend on suitable tools and gov-
ernance structures, as well as adequate capacity (medium confi-
dence). Managing trade-offs and synergies is challenging and requires
tools to help understand interactions and support decision-making
at local and regional scales. Integrated responses also depend on
governance that enables coordination across scales and sectors, sup-
ported by appropriate institutions. Developing and implementing
suitable tools and governance structures often requires upgrading
the human and institutional capacity to design and deploy integrated
responses. {WGII SPM C-1, SPM C-2, 2.2, 2.4, 15.4, 15.5, 16.3, Table 14-1,
Table 16-1, WGIII TS.1, TS.3, 15.2}
An integrated approach to energy planning and implementation
that explicitly assesses the potential for co-benefits and the
presence of adverse side effects can capture complementarities
across multiple climate, social and environmental objectives
(medium confidence). There are strong interactive effects across
various energy policy objectives, such as energy security, air quality,
health and energy access (see Figure 3.5) and between a range of
social and environmental objectives and climate mitigation objectives
(see Table 4.5). An integrated approach can be assisted by tools such as
cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, multi-criteria analysis
and expected utility theory. It also requires appropriate coordinating
institutions. {WGIII Figure SPM.6, TS.1, TS.3}
Explicit consideration of interactions among water, food, energy
and biological carbon sequestration plays an important role in
supporting effective decisions for climate resilient pathways
(medium evidence, high agreement). Both biofuel-based power
generation and large-scale afforestation designed to mitigate climate
change can reduce catchment run-off, which may conflict with alter-
native water uses for food production, human consumption or the
maintenance of ecosystem function and services (see also Box 3.4).
Conversely, irrigation can increase the climate resilience of food and
fibre production but reduces water availability for other uses. {WGII
Box CC-WE, Box TS.9}
An integrated response to urbanization provides substantial
opportunities for enhanced resilience, reduced emissions and
more sustainable development (medium confidence). Urban
areas account for more than half of global primary energy use and
energy-related CO2 emissions (medium evidence, high agreement) and
contain a high proportion of the population and economic activities at
risk from climate change. In rapidly growing and urbanizing regions,
mitigation strategies based on spatial planning and efficient infrastruc-
ture supply can avoid the lock-in of high emission patterns. Mixed-use
zoning, transport-oriented development, increased density and co-lo-
cated jobs and homes can reduce direct and indirect energy use across
sectors. Compact development of urban spaces and intelligent densi-
fication can preserve land carbon stocks and land for agriculture and
bioenergy. Reduced energy and water consumption in urban areas
through greening cities and recycling water are examples of mitigation
actions with adaptation benefits. Building resilient infrastructure sys-
tems can reduce vulnerability of urban settlements and cities to coastal
flooding, sea level rise and other climate-induced stresses. {WGII
