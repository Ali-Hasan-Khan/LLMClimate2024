       "'4Summary for PolicymakersSummary for PolicymakersA. Current Status and Trends\\nObserved Warming and its Causes\\nA.1 Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally \\ncaused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850-1900 \\nin 2011-2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase, with unequal \\nhistorical and ongoing contributions arising from unsustainable energy use, land use and \\nland-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production across regions, \\nbetween and within countries, and among individuals (high confdence). {2.1, Figure 2.1, \\nFigure 2.2}\\nA.1.1 Global surface temperature was 1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C5 higher in 2011–2020 than 1850–19006, with larger increases \\nover land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean (0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C). Global surface temperature in the \\ue01erst two \\ndecades of the 21st century (2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10]°C higher than 1850–1900. Global surface temperature \\nhas increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (high con\\ue01fdence). \\n{2.1.1, Figure 2.1}\\nA.1.2  The likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase from 1850–1900 to 2010–20197 is 0.8°C to \\n1.3°C, with a best estimate of 1.07°C. Over this period, it is likely that well-mixed greenhouse gases (GHGs) contributed \\na warming of 1.0°C to 2.0°C8, and other human drivers (principally aerosols) contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, \\nnatural (solar and volcanic) drivers changed global surface temperature by –0.1°C to +0.1°C, and internal variability \\nchanged it by –0.2°C to +0.2°C. {2.1.1, Figure 2.1}\\nA.1.3 Observed increases in well-mixed GHG concentrations since around 1750 are unequivocally caused by GHG emissions \\nfrom human activities over this period. Historical cumulative net CO 2 emissions from 1850 to 2019 were 2400 ± 240 GtCO 2 \\nof which more than half (58%) occurred between 1850 and 1989, and about 42% occurred between 1990 and 2019 (high \\ncon\\ue01fdence). In 2019, atmospheric CO 2 concentrations (410 parts per million) were higher than at any time in at least 2 \\nmillion years (high con\\ue01fdence), and concentrations of methane (1866 parts per billion) and nitrous oxide (332 parts per \\nbillion) were higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years (very high con\\ue01fdence). {2.1.1, Figure 2.1}\\nA.1.4 Global net anthropogenic GHG emissions have been estimated to be 59 ± 6.6 GtCO 2-eq9 in 2019, about 12% (6.5 GtCO 2-eq) \\nhigher than in 2010 and 54% (21 GtCO 2-eq) higher than in 1990, with the largest share and growth in gross GHG emissions \\noccurring in CO 2 from fossil fuels combustion and industrial processes (CO 2-FFI) followed by methane, whereas the highest \\nrelative growth occurred in \\ue01duorinated gases (F-gases), starting from low levels in 1990.
